very cool location friendly staff public transport right outside the door,0
cleanliness should be improved check and clean rooms daily to make it one of the top value for money hostels in london,1
wasnt aware i would be moved to another location 510 min away,0
wifi wasnt the greatest as i could only use it in the lobby and not my room,0
overall it was okay and staff was friendly,0
the atmosphere was weird,0
lots of old people and not good for socialising,0
the staff were either rude or untrained,0
they blocked off one of the main social areas to practice their music for their performance that nightsuper awkward,0
the mats in the bathroom were stinky and dirty,1
the location was away from everything but hyde parkno grocery stores nearby and a longer walk to the underground,0
the beds are sturdy but one of the wooden lockers didnt work,0
stay elsewhere if you can afford it ,0
we stayed in the backpacker area,0
the room was okay,0
but there was only a tiny window with basically no natural light,0
so it wasnt a place to hang out,0
a small but really nice modern kitchen,0
location had good transport links and many walking tours started at the station just round the corner,0
communal bathrooms separate genders were nice,0
not a great introduction to berlin,0
the location is very far from most areas easily recognized as berlin and because of a miscommunication in which we thought we could check in before 3pm we were treated pretty rudely by the first employee we interacted with,0
the main area is very big but not cozy or welcoming like other hostels ive been in,0
because of this no one really talks to each other,0
lastly it was extremely hot during our visit with no fans available,0
so the hostel was great but the staff were unhelpful and not very sympathetic when i dropped my phone down the elevator  yes this is my fault but they first told me they could get it out and then later they told me it costs 400 euros to open up the elevator,0
this obviously ruined my experience at the one 80 hostel,0
my friend who has also lost her phone down an elevator told me that all they wouldve had to do is make the list go up two floors and then open it from th ground floor,0
great location,0
always action and plenty of places to eat and view from the platz,0
hbf is just minutes away so youre just a hop away from your next destination ,0
be aware that it is very young crowd at this hostel ,0
i had a couple of issues with just youngins room hopping and taking over beds that were not assigned to them,0
luckily the front desk people were understanding and assisted me in moving into a separate room with less people ,0
downside no air conhot summer nights,0
a newly opened hostel on the south side of shimokitazawa station,0
took a gamble booking here when there were still no reviews online at the time but it was a great experience,0
stayed in a single dormitory pod,0
the location is perfect and the staff are mostly quite kind and helpful,0
my only complaint is that its a little expensive as hostels go and the lack of a kitchen and laundry facilities does not really reflect the price that you pay per night,0
that being said ill definitely be back,0
had a great stay in the hostel staff where very good and easy to talk too ,0
great location for the clubbing side of berlin ,0
would highly recommend ,0
,
,
plug inn was a wonderful place to stay,0
it was very clean and there was breakfast every morning,1
there was no ac but the fan helped,0
there are 3 train stations close by and the beautiful sacre coeur and montmarte areas were all in walking distance,0
a short train ride to many other sightseeing places,0
the shower and elevator were very small and to get there is a lot of uphill walking,0
great hostel  perfect location and very clean,0
will definitely stay again,0
great hostel,0
great staff and good value for money but air conditioning must be installed in all rooms for future recommendation,0
great staff very friendly and providing very useful advice,0
cleanest hostel wed stayed at on the whole three week trip,1
the hostel bar was cosy however a little bit on the small side,0
fantastic location overall a great hostel that id definitely recommend to anyone wanting to visit berlin,0
will hopefully be back ,0
of all the hostels ive stayed in this one was the best,0
i highly recommend st christophers inn gare du nord in paris ,0
the hostel was clean the atmosphere lively the staff was friendly and helpful and i felt secure and safe staying there,1
the rooms were nice spacious enough and unlike other hostels ive stayed in provided a bed with plug points for chargers a privacy curtain and a spacious locker under the beds,0
bathrooms were clean and relatively good in size too,0
showers and bathroom were dirty shower water fills up the first staff member at the desk said he didnt have shampoo or shower gel but later someone else did have,1
the same original staff member was very unhelpful when i asked for a place to eat nearby his only recommendation he could think of was burger king,0
elevators were broken son needed to walk up and down to the 7th floor,0
nice bar and outside and pretty cheap,0
it was a last minute booking,0
right near the train which was nice,0
great location no frills hostel,0
this is my goto place when staying in hongdae,0
i stayed in paddington pride and had a good time,0
it seems its just a restaurant but there is quite a big hostel above it,0
if you want to meet other travellers it might not be the place to go,0
if its just to stay for the night its a really nice place ,0
i did have a little issue with the manager because she told me i had to check out early what wasnt agreed upon,0
but the service in the restaurant was excellent,0
fast very friendly and good food,0
special compliments to the waitress yanella,0
this hostel is one of the best that ive ever stayed at,0
the bathrooms were super nice and clean the staff was hilarious and extremely helpful and the downstairs is so much fun,1
the breakfast staff were very sweet too,0
definitely would recommend for meeting new people and solo travelers,0
location was spot on as well 10 minute walk from the tower bridgetower of london and there are bikes for rent for cheap just outside of the hostel,0
oh and you get a free drink at the bar with your check in,0
i got in so around 11 pm and left by 530 am so i cant give much a review,0
staff was helpful as i was confused about what tube lines i could access with closures for my trip the next morning,0
had an atm in the lobby,0
this place probably feels closet to the hotel that you can get with a hostel,0
wifi is good private bathrooms with a shower,0
closer to elephant and castle station which makes it very easy transfer if you use gatwick airport,0
everything was fine i loved the place,0
i checked into this hostel for the night before melt festival,0
i stayed in a room that had many items left from previous travellers that i was told were free if i wanted them,0
more seemed like a reason not to clean it up or throw it away ,1
the water was cold ice cold and was told it would be fixed was not fixed for the entire duration of my stay,0
the actual hostel itself had a strange smell,1
the staff didnt look like they wanted to be there,0
good location though,0
âœ”,0
ï¸,0
the hostel was good enough as it was my first stay in a hostel it was great ,0
the area around the hostel is totally safe i recommend this hostel for solo travelers male or female dont worry just go there and have fun,0
hostel caught fire during the night and we had to be evacuated,0
we didnt get any sleep as the fire alarm kept going off,0
we werent offered a refund except we were allowed to check out an hour earlier,0
no real apologies,0
we kept getting told that we were lucky it wasnt worse,0
not having the hostel burn down is a pretty low standard,0
the room was super hot and there was no aircon aswell,0
room was dirty and the sink was leaking in our room,1
good location and breakfast included which is a postive,0
the host was clean but and location was okay for getting to a bustrain station,1
the area the hostle is located was pretty sketchy and not much to do with in walking distance,0
it is a nice place to stay in berlin,0
i had a lot of fun in there facilities are excellent,0
the location is what sells this place,0
i was able to see and do so many things just by walking,0
the security was good and for old the building was the cleanliness was decent,1
however at one point the water was so hot in the shower i couldnt even shower as it was scalding hot,0
i didnt have very much interaction with the staff,0
i would stay here again,0
great place very clean and very easy to meet new people in the happy hour,1
the breakfast was really worth the price staff were friendly and the rooms are comfortable and clean,0
would definitely recommend for solo travelers,0
the shower in the room was plugged and there was only one shower for 8 person,0
also the room for 8 person was too small and also there was not enough conditioner,0
so it was too hot,0
 the hostel is very intetesting and nice ,0
pretty far from a lot of things,0
but i met great people and had a lot of fun,0
zzzip is absolutely one of the best hostels ive ever stayed at,0
its clean safe affordable and the owners brian and jina are super helpful,1
they give awesome general recommendations for seoul or hostel recommendations if youre staying in another city have cheap fees for renting towels or doing laundry and will even call local places to order food if you arent fluent in korean,0
i will definitely stay here again next time im in seoul,0
great customer service ,0
spacious room and clean,1
clean fairly modern comfortable beds,1
seems secure,0
staff were helpful ,0
literally around the corner from gare du nord which can be good and bad,0
handy for transport purposes but the neighborhood is a bit rough looking especially at night,0
shocking try to fit 6 people and their bags into a room that should sleep 2 at most uncomfortable and the bathrooms werent the cleanest,1
absolutely wouldnt recommend,0
staff were great and helpful it is nice to have a laundry facility that you can use free of charge the location is not amazing but it is handy as it is just opposite to a subway station ,0
fridge was very small and we couldnt fit our stuff the room and toilets were not very clean in the shower area there was no place to hang clothes and towel very annoying,1
good hostel rooms are nice with comfortable beds and decent bathrooms,0
friendly staff who are helpful,0
good â‚¬7 breakfast in a morning,0
very close to a metro station literally around the corner close to shops bars and the berlin wall,0
its a bit of a party atmosphere hostel but its that big that anyone who is travelling would fit in here,0
clink78 was very well staffed,0
cheap drinks and good atmosphere,0
so convenient if you are traveling through st pancreas as it is less than a 10 minute walk to the station,0
great option if you are looking to stay near kings cross,0
my only complaint was the showers on the top floor ran cold,0
ended up going down a floor and the showers were warm there,0
so not a huge inconvenience,0
rooms got really hot but it was nice having a private bathroom,0
the staff seemed really nice and cool but they had no sense of urgency or interest in doing any of their jobs,0
the check in line was out the door for an hour,0
other than that a really nice stay,0
met lots of people and the location was good,0
had to book this pretty last minute and couldnt have been more pleased,0
great location and really helpful staff,0
the manager jonny was full of great recommendations and good for more than a few laughs,0
i know where ill be staying when i come back to london,0
my 1st time travelling solo as a transgender person m to f a member of the lgbt community,0
i felt at ease no stress and the staff were very helpful and friendly,0
clean and well managed top location easy connections and close to transport,1
highly recommended,0
i loved the location close proximity to the underground station and all eateries,0
it was clean for a hostel despite the many guests present,1
the room was quite and breakfast was ok,0
very cost effective and would stay at the hostel again,0
should i visit london,0
perfect place for short durationwas there for 2 nights ,0
grand old hotel many stairs many coming and going great location helpful staff,0
i was discouraged by the bathroom facilities in this particular hostel,0
i was even more surprised that the other st christophers the village in london had a better atmosphere and cared more about cleanliness,1
the showers if i can even call them that were atrocious,1
i did not feel comfortable,0
i spent a week here and it was fantastic,0
the people were so welcoming and friendly and it was just overall a place i would definitely stay again,0
overall great stay amazing area clean facilities helpful staff,1
paris is expensive but this is a great option for the price ,0
some cons not amazing communal vibe no organized events only 1 outlet per room beds slightly creaky ,0
side note check out anthony bosson boulanger a few blocks away for amazing pastries and coffee get kouign aman or macarons if you enjoy starting your day that way,0
gorgeous hostel so handy for the metro,0
the room only had two sockets between 8 beds thankfully the room was only half full and had limited charging points downstairs ,0
staff were nice,0
ok so this place was pretty great ,0
the atmosphere was friendly and social had a fantastic kitchen  eating space  outdoor area  relaxing lounge area to chat with other travellers,0
the rooms were so clean  had lights and charger ports by the bed,1
the bathrooms were very clean the staff were so friendly,1
only glitch i would say is that the shower in the room,0
i was in didnt drain properly and leaked under the glass door  cold check in ,0
300pm was very slow as everyone was checking in,0
good afternoon im requesting a chargeback of my credit card for improper charges ,0
my daughter stayed at the hostel on 06212018 and as soon as we arrived at the property made the cancellation on 06252018 ,0
to my surprise not covering on the credit card,0
attached photo ,0
you can check in the hostel that we used the stays of 06232018 and 06242018 we canceled the 06252018 and paid the difference that was missing in the place in cash,0
no proof of payment was provided ,0
please verify it,0
hostel was very nice,0
staff were friendly and location was very good,0
the bathroom in the room was very small which was difficult to use,0
this is a great hostel,0
i loved the location and the facilities were clean and nice,1
i would highly recommend it to other travellers,0
great location and friendly staff but the atmosphere isnt great for solotravellers,0
the common area was empty and the loungebar was closed for private events a couple times,0
i stayed in the dormstyle room on the upper deck and needed to keep the window open because of the heat though the kitchen staff made a lot of noise during cleanup and people would sit outside the window to smoke and chat which made it difficult to sleep,1
though they assign you to a room they dont always assign you to a bed which was problematic because i heard two seperate occasions of people complaining others were in their bed or had moved their stuff,0
the majority of the people staying were older men which made me feel a bit uncomfortable as a 19 year old female traveling alone,0
the bathrooms arent great you essentially have to be naked in front of a lot of others and the outlet on my bed was broken which made my trip very hard,0
very satisfied overall,0
good hostel quite clean compared to the rest of delhi its perfect good location bit of a lack of atmosphere though,1
its a good hostel but doesnt fall in the category of the best positives ,0
1,
the location is amazing,0
everything is in the radius of 2 kms 2,0
hostel and rooms are huge 3,0
very clean negatives 1,1
breakfast is not included neither you can cook 2,0
lockers are very thin,0
cant even put a bag,0
you can only keep important docs 3,0
there are only 4 commodes,0
2 for males and 2 for females on a floor with 150 beds 4,0
shower area just has curtains not a proper closure 5,0
only 3 sockets in a room of 6,0
good location nice staff not many showers 23 for one floor but fortunately i never had to wait  ,0
its probably better value than most other hostels considering its paris,0
but i agree with some of the reviews i read,0
there are a couple of staff members that are very friendly while others are just v difficult to speak to or ask questions,0
there is no communal kitchen and everything they offer food wise is quite expensive,0
close to metro,0
its clean but all the shower curtains suffer from a ton of mold thus the poop smell,1
great people,0
perfect for groups even better for solo,0
gregs a g too,0
theres nothing really wrong with this hostel but theres nothing thats great about it either,0
the rooms are quite small and so maneuvering around roommates can get quite interesting,0
the bathrooms are also very small and the floor is often wet as the shower curtain rarely manages to keep all the water in,0
the hostel is located near two metro stops which is a great help,0
theres no common room apart from the kitchen which is not the most comfortable but fine for 1 or 2 nights id say,0
quiet yet central  10  15 minutes walk from the arc de triomphe,0
the hostel is very close to the metro,0
the building combines cool modernity with architectural grandeur ,0
very clean and a very good breakfast with lots of choice,0
the staff are friendly and speak good english,0
the shower rooms i used were cool and modern,0
parc monceau is a nice park near by there is a lovely courtyard with chairs and tables,0
i would highly recomend this hostel,0
clean and friendly hostel with a decent free breakfast,1
6 share room was pretty pokey and was hard to find space to put a bag,0
had to hire a locker which was a bit annoying,0
overall decent enough accommodation for a bed to sleep in in a very good london location,0
its very nice for the price,0
rooms are clean and so are the showers,1
outlets and reliable wifi,0
there are storage lockers for the day to put belongings and its 5â‚¬ per day which was nice bc i wanted to explore the city more before my 10pm train and wanted to check out in the morning,0
for me i just needed a place to put my head and shower after a day of exploring but overall very nice,0
great hostel will definitely be staying here if i go to berlin again,0
great location great hosts,0
will definitely return,0
nice location very helpful staff,0
i stayed two nights and feel prertty satisfied it was queiet at night although i was in a dorm for 30 people everybody was respectful and,0
there r nice areas to relax,0
the only thing that bothered me and i can give it as a suggestion is to give adaptors for the elextricity for rent instead of selling them because if a person plans to stay for a short time in england it is a useless ourchase to be made,0
staff were good and helpful in most respects ,0
security of baggage was not managed easily,0
Â£250  Â£350 would be charged to stow items in a basement not easily accessable,0
this was automated and when power tripped out on the system things rapidly became unstuck,0
the hostel accepted guests in groups who were not of sufficient agematurity,0
one such first in my dorm arriving in the middle of the night throwing up and calling an ambulance having been drunk for the first time,0
otherwise good ,0
cool interior reasonably easy to meet people but not super social,0
wouldnt recommend for solo travelers,0
bathrooms were often gross one didnt have running water and the wifi worked very poorly in the common rooms and not at all in the dorms themselves,1
also in a pretty sketchy area,0
i was recommended not to leave or come back from the ubahn alone at night as the station across the street is surrounded by squatters,0
theres a lot of reasonably priced food nearby though and subway is close,0
astors museum hostel is in the most perfect location which makes sightseeing around london easy especially for those on a time crunch,0
the hostel has the most helpful and knowledgeable staff who made awesome restaurant and sightseeing recommendations,0
this hostel has an amazing industrialstyle kitchen which is perfect for cooking,0
i stayed in the 16bed dorm and found the room to be spacious enough with linens provided,0
overall the hostel had a good atmosphere and was very sociable,0
this hostel was so comfortable and safe,0
even the breakfast went above and beyond,0
five stars dude ðŸ’–,0
they have a daily room cleaning staff and a swimming pool which is pretty amazing for a hostel,1
really lovely place had a great stay,0
very helpful staff lots of amenities and differ parts of the hostel to explore,0
huge bar,0
the location is really cool near the east wall gallery and the river just a quick transit to get to the centre,0
close to lots of nightclubs,0
just bring a lock for your locker,0
room was a little dark and noisy because the windows open onto the street,0
shower a bit busted,0
great location and facilities,0
super clean,1
staing there was fun,0
everything was clean,1
but for anyone with an interrail ticket expecting to get a 10 discount you only get it if you book through famous hostels,0
i booked through hostelworld and didnt get the discount,0
it was a nice place to stay but the room didnt get cleaned very well and the shower smelled like mildew,1
the bar was understaffed and the rooftop bar was always too crowded,0
overall an average place to stay and not really worth the money,0
you get what you pay for,0
but overall i would recommend the hostel to others,0
staff is really nice and the bathroom is big and private,0
nice stay,0
big hostel,0
room was great,0
the pool area was being under renovation though,0
overall great experience,0
very welcoming environment and was able to do everything that i would need in a hostel shower laundry storage etc it is a little loud at times but nothing to unbearable bring ear plugs,0
great place and highly suggest,0
this is the worst hostel i have stayed in,0
this hostel is absolutely disgusting there are so many things wrong with it,1
i cant mention them all,0
but cleanliness was the worst,1
sheets were stained,1
the common area is always dirty and really sticky we were so disgusted we didnt eat because everything was so dirty,1
we were so disgusted we chose to go to another hostel and even though this was their own fault they refused to reimburse us for the nights we did not stay there,1
room had a small window that wouldnt open in the middle of june,0
we pretty much fried in the room it was extremely uncomfortable,0
bathrooms were not well maintained,0
i was a bit disappointed,0
i had to move beds 3 times before i could assign myself,0
while this was going on the employee was talking about how much she hates her job,0
and i dont think i saw a single employee who seemed happy during my stay,0
that makes me a bit worried they arent treated well,0
also definitely felt the need to check for bedbugs,1
not clean mold in showers,1
two girls were moved from my room because of creepy dude idk,0
i would not stay again,0
too expensive for all that,0
great staff great location only thing is that the train is right there so thats pretty noisy bring a fan,0
it gets pretty hot as well but all in all great eviroment,0
i would come stay again,0
i had a great stay here,0
amazing service for a hostel free fresh towel daily,0
the hostel felt very safe,0
i was very comfortable in the room,0
the only thing is if you are a solo female like me i would avoid arriving here late at night,0
i did have some guys follow me,0
but it is close to the train station so its not too hard to make a quick dash,0
my one advice if you re a female go to to a girl dormitory,0
great for a good nights sleep,0
as a solo traveller the common area wasnt the best to mingle with other travellers,0
staff were fantastic extremely friendly and happy to help with luggage storage etc,0
i felt very welcome here,0
close to a train station but also can comfortably walk to westminster and around,0
not a loud party hostel,0
so its perfect for a good nights sleep in a good location,0
would recommend,0
the hostel was unbearably hot,0
also the room i was in the windows have no curtains so the sun was beaming down on you very early,0
there was also a lot of noise from the road that made it hard to sleep,0
the staff were nice and helpful,0
the bar was good but they would blast music when nobody was in the bar so it was hard to meet people and have a conversation,0
awesome place highly recommended,0
great location if you have flights to catch,0
the beer vending machine is cool,0
theres a lawson close by and the atmosphere is pretty chill,0
you get alot for the price ,0
nice hostel with charakter ,0
this is my 4th time staying at zzzip guesthouse,0
and i always stay here when i visit seoul,0
it feels like a home away from home,0
great experience the staff was amazing helped me whenever i needed,0
the room was clean and organized just the common bathroom could be a little cleaner,1
the bar adjacent to the hostel is a positive extra with good food and ok prices just for food alcohol was a little bit pricey on my opinion ,0
just two negative things i would like to point the towel was not included and i had to buy a padlock to secure my stuff on the proper place,0
in those two thing i spent 8â‚¬ that i didnt expected,0
cool place with good vibes but dirty and not in the most convenient location,0
had to sleep in the lobby because our flight was cancelled and we missed our initial booking date,0
once you arrive everyone is asked to take off shoes i figured out later,0
this is because they dont clean and so it reduces possible dirt on the floors,1
showers werent cleaned at all over my stay,1
i asked if there was a cleaner and was told they clean if they have a chance,1
this raises alarm bells for me as hostels need to be kept clean every day,1
no signs outside so confusing to find,0
entry hall and stairs has filthy carpet,1
i wont be staying there again and i recommend staying elsewhere,0
nice location near the borough market london bridge station and the iron square,0
bathrooms and rooms appear to be newly renovated,0
staying at leo great wall hostel was really nice,0
the staff were down to earth at their was a nice relaxing atmosphere,0
you can clearly see the great wall from the hostel and there isnt as many tourist on that part of the wall that there might could be,0
the owner also has a small restaurant where you can buy food and drinking water soda etc,0
although it was a bit expensive compared to the prices near the city,0
definitely worth staying and would at any time recommend it,0
nathan was the best host,0
he was very informative and helpful on local eateries and sights,0
felt right at home soon as i walked in,0
definitely coming back here on my next trip to london,0
someone took my cash from the room and it was a horrible experience,0
i know i should have been more vigilant but the staff was barely helpful and all they did was showed sympathy and gave me the address of the police station,0
my money was in the room and its either one of the people who slept in the same room that night or it was housekeeping who took it,0
they should put automatic lockers in the hostel,0
clean hostel located in good area not far from 2 subway stations with easy access to lots of facilities including a small mall across the road,0
opportunity to sign up to tours incl niagara falls,0
sockets in the dorm limited and location of beds did not accomodate adaptors,0
when beds were moved slightly so i could charge  it was promptly moved back in one case damaging the plug,0
staff were not always available especially when booking activities and atmosphere was not always that welcoming,0
honestly i was so happy to relax at this hostel,0
it was the first hostel i stayed in where i felt like i had a family to talk with and and out with each night ,0
showers only on the ground floor but enough toilets on each level,0
had a 2night stay here after a trip around china,0
its a great location just under tianmen square,0
lots of shops and resturants near by,0
had 2 leaving drinks 2 different groups here and the bar and staff are amazing,0
gnts for 20yuan metro is about 15min walk breakfast isnt too bad either ,0
lockers are big and bathroom was clean and tidy in the 4man room,0
safe and secure and doodles from every corner on the earth on anything that is nailed down,0
would deffo reccomend,0
best hostel i stayed at during my whole 6 week holiday,0
great atmosphere  great rooms only wish that the bunk beds were a little sturdier,0
first two nights here were fine third night my friend saw something crawling across her bed,1
long story short it turned out to be a bed bug which we killed,1
left and had to find a hotel at 1 am,0
if you need a cheapeasy place to stay this is an option,0
the staff was friendly and provided me with a towel pillow sheet and duvet,0
the dorm beds are assigned bed 6 in room 14s privacy curtain included the inroom security lockers that everyone used so it wasnt actually private,0
space livable but not clean there were cobwebs and water damage over the bed grimemildew on the shower light,0
staff cleaned spaces regularly,1
the front door 10 clarence sq was never locked at night,0
the hostel was clean and the beds were comfy,1
lockers were a bit small but not a major problem,0
however we arrived about 11pm,0
the area doesnt feel at all safe and is a long way from the city centre,0
when we arrived the guy on the front desk barely said hello and was not at all welcoming,0
safe to say we both felt very unsafe on our first night,0
there was a timetable of events for each night but they were poorly organised so no one actually went to them,0
as a result the atmosphere was dull,0
the staff were great and really accommodating it was clean and super cute and the beds were nice,1
only complaint is lack of ac and the windows in my room were not allowed to be opened so it was extremely hot in the room,0
otherwise great experience,0
great place to spend a night or two,0
theres ample security and a friendly staff,0
it is a little bit away from the closest metro but honestly thats not a big issue,0
theyre arent any outlets by the beds and the lockers are only large enough to fit small valuables passport camera small tablet,0
good wifi that works in the rooms,0
unique neighborhood with lots of restaurants and metro stops close,0
the food they serve is ok i would recommend eating somewhere else,0
they have ac which is great in the hot summer months,0
me and my partner booked a private room in this hostel but my mistake we were taken into a hotel room,0
with luxurious bedding and bathroom to match it was one of best stays on our 5 month tour to match,0
on top of that a full kitchen with a broad breakfast on offer â‚¬7 and a bar with the cheapest beer in town,0
all in all we didnt enjoy leaving,0
overall was a great stay,0
however be aware that the elevator is out of order yet our whole stay no workers were there to fix it,0
and i had read previous reviews saying that it was out of order during their stay,0
this meant we had to climb the five flights of stairs with our20kg of luggage,0
the facility was very clean and the location was perfect close to supermarkets markets pubs and the london bridge underground station,1
most staff are helpful however some were unhelpful,0
if you are a budget traveller like me this is your spot,0
we had a private room for 2 nights and it was great,0
and i have stayed at other hostels in different countries,0
for a private room you get a double bed kettle filtered water tea tv with on demand movies and shows and large closet,0
it was a quiet stay rarely bumped into other people but you are right across from an outdoor food and drinks park lots of food drinks people and live music,0
youre a 6 minute walk from borough market too,0
it was okey,0
it was dirty under the bed and on the floors in our room,1
rude staff,0
myself and my friend stayed at the buget london apartments for 3 nights for wireless festival,0
in london,0
and i can truely say that it was perfect for us because we knew we wouldnt be spending much time in the rooms,0
 it was good value for money and basic facilities like showers,0
fridges etc were up to good standard,0
perfect location very friendly staff very safe very clean staff speaks english quite well  felt at home there,1
would definitely come back,0
not a place to meet other people of my age though,0
mostly very friendly,0
koreans visiting,0
still if you dont want to meet lots of people go there,0
the restaurent part was a bit in the expensive side but had quite a variety to choose from,0
the plugs werent abundant and there were no curtains for the beds in the dorm,0
good simple hostel the rooms are pretty small but some have balconies which is nice,0
the part of paris is a bit more sketch but not to bad and convenient access to metro,0
we got a room that had no air condition what so ever so we opened the window to get some air in but then we couldnt sleep since there was so much noise from the kitchen and bar ,0
then it also felt like we were staying in a kitchen since it was smelling like a kitchen with whatever dishes they were making down there ,0
we politely asked to change room but there was no can do according to the staff we asked so we just had hang in there those 3 nights we stayed  ,0
booked two nights at first and ended up coming back after a couple of days could not extend directly because it was full during the weekend,0
the location is just perfect for this price,0
the hostel has a chilled atmosphere a place to get back to after the crazyness if the city and relax,0
the curtains on the beds give you the privacy to do so,0
the staff was very nice and breakfast had more than i heard from other hostels,0
kitchen closes at night,0
an ok breakfast,0
mÃ¼sli and croissant and a small bread,0
bathroom in the room which is great,0
u can walk into the hostel all the way up to the rooms without any security,0
for the rooms you need cars keys,0
super hostel,0
staff were very friendly,0
it was clean ,0
great location for me as i needed to take the coach from victoria coach station when i left,0
there is also a tube station not far away ,0
i was a solo traveler for one night staying for a training day,0
so didnt want some kind of party hostel as the area is residential it was perfect,0
however without air con it was way too hot in the room and even with a fan for the 6 bed dorm i really didnt sleep well,0
good vibe and lockers for security,0
the most i found nice during my stay was the room with a nice bedroom and the lockers for personal stuff,0
it would be great if the hostel could has kitchen for guests,0
great price considering the location,0
ac worked great and the bed was comfortable,0
this was one of the best hostel ive stayed in period,0
it was just opened a few weeks ago and looks  feels brand new,0
good new comfortable beds brand new showers and toilets shower probably the best ive seen in a hostel free dinner,1
and the staff is great and lots of fun  ,0
ps,0
if you happen to see some reviews on google maps  those are for a different hostel that used to be there with a different name  owners,0
i got a bit scared first but this is an awesome new hostel ,0
i think the boat has sailed for me and hostels,0
the overall vibe was nice and the staff were good at wombats but the bed was absolutely filthy and the room was oppressively hot,1
i didnt stay for the night,0
picked up my bag later that evening and went to the travelodge,0
cute place,0
very nice staff,0
the room was ridiculously hot all roommates complaining about it and having a hard time to staysleep,0
when i talked to the reception the answer was there is nothing we can do it is not usually this hot in london,0
not even a fan,0
the windows are right in front of a construction and besides that there is an annpying sound 24x7 not sure what that is probably a machine always on ,0
location is ok the hostel is very nice,0
staff not really,0
bathroom inside the room was good,0
and again st christophers inn hammersmith has been a perfect getaway,0
awesome location an easy access to public transport comfy beds friendly and helpful staff members,0
10 out of 10 ,0
as well the discounted drinks at belushis pub and banging tunes from dj made my wednesday night extra fun ,0
cheers team ,0
comparing to other cheap hostel i can say tha one is one of the best for its price,0
sometimes internet connection was poor and also we had to wait a whole week until we can connect to the internet again,0
i would have been happier if those guys could keep the toilets cleaner,1
365 inn was absolutely a great choice,0
the hostel is conveniently located on a busyish street with lots of restaurants and shops,0
the closest train station is about 1012 minutes away and the area felt safe,0
we stayed for about 4 days3 nights and we were really happy with our private room with private bathroom,0
the hostel has a nice vibe to it,0
there is a bar and restaurant within and let me tell you after being on a plane for 13 hours a bar was very welcomed,0
overall we were really pleased,0
staff are amazing,0
nice hostel clean and comfortable beds and fab wifi in the cafe,0
you can rent a lock for the lockers if you want and the shower rooms were never busy,0
we arrived extremely late  were greeted by the best lowkey  super cool midnight shift crew,0
the lift was out of service as someone wa prior back injury i had to be really mindful of going up  down stairs w luggage they just put me on the 1st level ,0
the hostel is in great form and is still undergoing even more improvements with another mural of the city scape,0
the restaurant food is great  the world cup is giving the place extra life ,0
we had a great time,0
miss it already,0
thx,0
st christophers inn was a good beginning hostel ,0
pros near 2 central subway stations so getting around the city was easy had a diverse amount of shops and markets nearby some open on sundays friendly and helpful staff lots of good tourist info maps guides discounted tours etc and a nice bar beneath the hostel ,0
cons,0
when we first arrived our bedding was dirty though it was changed after we alerted the staff breakfast was so so rooms could get hot if the ac was not left on 247,1
i think hostelworld messed up and only booked 2 nights of the 5 that i actually scheduled for giving the benefit of the doubt,0
but everything turned out fine as i was able to sleep in the tea room,0
rooms and bathrooms are comfortably clean,1
the location is about a 15 minute walk to the closest subway station and you have to walk through an alley,0
what i did was rent a free bike from the hostel ride it to the closest subway station and left it there till i returned at night,0
overall i really enjoyed this place,0
very clean and well kept,0
evening activities posted on each floor and announced when youre checking in as well,0
breakfast spread is just bagels bananas and cereal so plan accordingly if you want a more hearty meal,0
would definitely recommend,0
they book up fast though so book early,0
just a good hostel and environment,0
big rooms,0
nice people,0
good location,0
demand is high so quality suffers,0
staffs attitude is hit  miss no matter how friendly you are,0
youre just another number in a region of the world where hostel demand is high,0
cleaning crew works very hard every day,1
great 1st floor if you like to be social,0
elevator next to reception works but reception probably wont tell you,0
aircon in every room is amazing very rare to find,0
first hostel ive visited that gets bombarded with a queue for 2pm check in needs a better system,0
b,
very good value for money with very low prices,0
location is very central a lot of places are walkable  not the place to stay if you were looking for the party area though,0
clean and well equipped,1
only large parts of the staff were super unfriendly and not helpful in answering questions,0
location was great  and the bed was comfortable ,0
but its too hot while i was staying there 2 nights,0
even,
we have had a fan running all day even in the midnigh ,0
by the way the noisy from the bar on ground floor was terrible ,0
it was terrible nights i have ever had been ,0
really good hostel especially for young people,0
great location and friendly staff,0
the 30 bed dorm wasnt too cramped and actually felt quite spacious with comfortable beds,0
luggage lockers were also available which was useful,0
it was by far the worst hostel i have ever stayed in,0
i stayed in a room for 10 people and they only had 4 plugs only close to the door not one for each bed and we had to take turns charging our phones also i couldnt be in my bed and near the phone at the same time,0
they didnt sell adaptors but they said they did,0
the wifi didnt work properly,0
they dont have a public kitchen which is ridiculous in a expensive city like paris,0
the key to our room was broken and we had to share it,0
overall,
a great place to stay at with just some minor issues of cleanliness,1
for starters we paid like twice to three times the amount for a dorm style room,0
they advertised 11â‚¬ on their windows,0
the wifi blows and doesnt really work at all,0
breakfast isnt included and not worth the 8â‚¬ they want for it,0
the top buck roomies dont have plugs near them,0
six people to share one bathroom so wake up early,0
there arent lockers in the rooms just some squeaky drawers on the beds that dont have locks,0
and the drawers are for two people,0
30 min train ride to city center,0
the hostel is really a great place to rest from all the busy life in berlins centre,0
it is yet very close thus an optimal location to both enjoy and find individual restaurants and relaxation,0
the staff of the hostel is incredibly warmhearted helpful and easygoing,0
the hostel is like a flat it is calm from 10 pm on and actually before too it feels like flatsharing and has a comfy kitchen living room  two bathrooms,0
it is quite clean and on opposite side it has a cool japanese restaurant,1
eventhough the showers were not clean and the neighbourhood was not the best we had a great stay there,1
the staff was very nice and was always willing to help,0
they spoke a broad variety of languages which was nice too,0
was only here for one night so i cannot speak much on atmosphere or how it is meeting other people ,0
but the staff was welcoming the room was clean and the location is walking distance to a few sights with buses that are easily accessible,1
just note the bus from the airport will drop you off conveniently close but they do not run prior to about 420am so plan accordingly if you have an early flight because a taxi to the airport is super expensive,0
good and beautiful hostel with a great atmosphere,0
there was no ac in our room,0
so it was hot in it,0
comfortable bunks roomy lockers and nice communal space downstairs with bar and courtyard,0
cleanliness left something to be desired the bathroom of our ensuite dorm smelled pretty unpleasant,1
no kitchen and the laundry was out of order when i was there,0
thought it was a bit expensive for what you got but overall met some great folks and enjoyed my stay ,0
i was only here for one night  but overall a good hostel to stay in,0
met some nice people but the common area seemed small,0
small but clean bathroom,1
lots of electrical plug ins,0
staff for both my check in and out were friendly,0
the hostel was ok for what i payed,0
i enjoyed my stay at wombat so much ,0
pros 1 great design and facilities  every bed had a mini shelf and socket many hooks in the room room is spacious 2 great location  walking distance to 3 subway stops and tower of london ,0
3 ambience  most of all i love the fun friendly and vibrant people and vibe here,0
i had so much fun and made so many friends ,0
i would highly recommend wombat and would stay here again ,0
hostel is super clean and relatively quiet but was full of school kids while i was there plus a few people over the age of 65 ,1
hard to get anything to eat and is in a scary neighbourhood,0
has absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever,0
great hostel the subway stop is right next to it which can be taken with jr it was clean and the staff are awesome but the pillows wernt the best,1
would definately reccommend though,0
were were told we were going to get an upgrade on arrival this didnt happen,0
the room was uncomfortably hot and windows only opened a crack so impossible to get any air in,0
at one stage we were standing near the open fridge trying to cool down,0
we left the door open to let a breeze in the first day but after that there was men in the room next to use smoking what i assume was marijuana and the pungent aroma meant that we had to suffer in the boiling heat again,0
no staff on arrival,0
amazing,
this hostel is incredible,0
located in a quiet and surreal forest on the outskirts of berlin its a great place to relax while still having easy access to the city,0
renting bikes is very easy through the hostel and the staff are so so nice,0
i had great conversations with the managers of the hostel,0
very fun game room and the bathrooms are very clean too,0
comfy beds,0
the best part by far is just being close to great walkingrunning trails and a very very dogfriendly lake ,0
decent hostel ,
three little pigs hostel really lacks atmosphere it seems like youre living in a old hospital,0
there are no social activities to take part in and it is not a place you go to meet new people,0
the location is decent enough for all the big sights not nightlife,0
the staff seems preoccupied with one another and did not seem welcoming nor friendly ,0
went to tokyo solo,0
met a bunch of cool people at the hostel,0
lots of great information was provided from the staff,0
highly recommend staying at this hostel,0
had great time excellent place to meet cool new people and party,0
i wish there was a filtered water station but other than that was awesome,0
definitely would come back,0
good hostel near of subway station but very little and not good for meet some people,0
rooms were clean,1
there are no private showers so that wasnt too comfortable,0
no other complaints really,0
hostel was great but the beds are rock hard,0
good place but no atmosphere,0
standard hostel with very nice staff,0
the weather was pretty hot while we were in london so the room was extremely warm and humid unfortunately,0
the shower area was not well kept and there were only two outlets in the room for 6 people,1
all in all the location was decent very close to an underground entrance and for the price this place was alright,0
rooms need a good clean showers need to have an option of cold need to be ladders to the upper bed and more fans,1
stayed in a 4 bed private room it was very clean and modern with a great private bathroom,1
stayed in august so the room was very hot and there was no ac and the window only open slightly,0
would definitely stay again though,0
we loved the atmosphere and the staff at the steam engine,0
they were friendly funny welcoming all that you can ask for,0
the beds were comfy and the rooms pretty quiet considering there was a bar under us and the street just outside,0
the hostel is also extremely well located ,0
our only issue would be the bathrooms,0
while they were clean for the most part the floors were often flooded from shower water,1
we think the bathrooms could use a little update to make this place even greater,0
i loved my stay at wise owl,0
its super close to the tube  major stations nice restaraunt a near by and shopssupermarkets,0
they have a bloody live owl at reception which i only found out on my last night which is awesome,0
bed was super comfy slept for 12 hours my first night,0
i didnt use the kitchen facilities so cant really comment there but the cafe downstairs is nice,0
lemonade on a hot day is perfect,0
would deffo stay again,0
also first time i had a duvet in 3 months,0
happy  ,
we had stayed in a number of hostels across europe and would have to say this one was the best,0
the bar staff were fantastic when we were there and the facilities were fantastic,0
the rooms and beds were great,0
it was hard to say goodbye,0
the staff was the best part about this hostel,0
it is out of the way of many of the main attractions and we had to take an uber to get everywhere which got a bit expensive,0
it is a great place to meet people especially for people in their early 20s,0
everyone seems to have been there for a while and they have become friends,0
everything seemed pretty clean just a bit grungy but not in a bad way,1
this is a great place to stay for someone backpacking on a budget looking to meet new people,0
very nice location,0
out of the normal tourist area,0
the staff was very helpful when the toilet clogged,1
breakfast is 1 euro for donation to charity but you have to get there early or there will be nothing left but toast,0
would stay there again,0
i only stayed here for my one night layover in delhi but it was a nice experience overall,0
the breakfast was really good  so was the dinner  cold beer they gave me when i arrived after a 17 hour flight,0
the staff and their friends were incredibly helpful and gave me tons of great tips on where to go during my short stay and how to get there ,0
only complaint is that it wasnt the greatest location,0
its a bit tucked down side streets and hard to find for uber and taxi drivers,0
the hostel is located very centrally and the stuff is very friendly and helpful,0
what i didnt like too much was the cleanliness,1
there were no lockers in the room so i out my stuff under my bed,0
once i took them out they were full of dust,0
also the toilets were always dirty and smelly,1
other than that everything was okay,0
this hostel was very charming and unique,0
the location was close to a train stop and easy to get to,0
i do wish there were more outlets in the rooms we had to rotate who could use the 2 outlets available,0
also be aware if you are located in the basement you will hear the music being played in the reception upstairs all night long,0
otherwise the staff was very nice and helpful food was good bathrooms were clean overall had a pleasant stay,1
is this a recently converted preschool,0
the mystery of what the hell happened here was the best part,0
its surrounded by nothing,0
no privacy for showers,0
had to search the room to plug my phone in far from my bed,0
the beds are reminiscent of mats from elementary school pe,0
â€”,
my back hurt instantly and i dont have back problems,0
no place to lock up valuables,0
got to breakfast 15 minutes before it closed and there was just cereal and nobody to change that,0
would not return,0
really close to kings cross great vibe and decor supervalue breakfast,0
you couldnt get a coffee for that price most places,0
only downside was our room was very hot and the fan provided inadequate,0
otherwise everything perfect ,0
comfy beds and everything superclean,1
this will be my goto hostel choice for future london trips,0
great place,0
good location and nice staff,0
this hostel has a very homelike feel,0
i really enjoyed my time here chatting with the staff in my bad japanese,0
fantastic staff,0
location is a bit far from the city but public transport is easy enough,0
great chilled out hostel,0
a beautiful place,0
but i would recommend more for groups,0
it was difficult to meet other solo travellers i found but everything else was lovely,0
one of the best hostels ive stayed in,0
super modern staff is wonderful beds are comfortable and the kitchen is primo,0
i couldnt of chose a better hostel to stay at while in london for the first time,0
i was on a solo trip and was able to meet so many other solo travelers,0
the bar was so fun and i definitely recommend going down there and talking to people,0
the room was great and i was lucky to have amazing roommates,0
i was in my room when the daily cleaning happened and they dont skimp on the cleaning and it shows,1
thanks for the great stay,0
not good for meeting people or young solo travellers  lots of kidsfamilies about,0
but clean with friendly staff and located right next to the central station,1
we stayed here for one night to explore berlin,0
it was a good base from which to do this and is in a great area,0
the staff were very helpful and we were able to drop off bags when we arrived too early to check in,0
the only major problem was that the showers did not feel particularly safe  each bathroom had two shower cubicles with seethrough glass and the doors did not lock meaning that anyone passing by in the corridor could walk in on you showering,0
other than that a good stay,0
cant really fault this place,0
each room has a split system air conditioning blinds across each bed linen provided and made on the bed plenty of bathrooms and showers on each level and clean,0
the chill out room is cool and the bar downstairs is great,0
would have been better if they organised pub crawls or events in the bar but seeing as it was a public bar with decent food and reasonable atmosphere most nights it was good enough value,0
good location although the map the give you isnt exactly to scale just look for mcdonalds  turn right basically ,0
apart from that the staff were incredibly helpful and they have a good value barrestaurant common area ,0
the rooms were comfortable and clean as were the showers etc ,0
just note that the tours that they offer are not run by them and you join a bigger group from different hostelshotels on a super big tourist bus ,0
overall keystone is a hostel that is to sleep and leave and explore right away,0
amazing location,0
4 minute walk to kings cross station,0
although the staff is very accommodating and sweet the facilities all over the entire hostel have a lingering pungent musty smell that makes it hard to walk into any room,1
my linens both times were not clean when i had issues with my first bed and was moved to a private room,1
but when i inspected the sheets there was a good amount of random debis in it still,1
the room 6 bed mixed was quite spacious,0
toilets and showers were clean and wellkept ,0
after the pub has closed guests must knock on the door and show a card in order to enter,0
i was allowed to sit in the closed pub after hours ,0
door codes are used rather than keys or keycards ,0
a towel can be bought not rented for 5 pounds ,0
late checkout is claimed but thats not true,0
checkout is at 10am which is earlier than normal,0
however its possible the staff do not strictly enforce this,0
le dÃ©jeuner dÃ©butait tardivement les gens de la cuisine,0
Ã©tait peu serviable,0
 pas de cuisine pas de couvrefeu bruyant pas de casier de sÃ©curitÃ© barrÃ©e,0
cÃ©tait propre,0
the staff are all lovely friendly and so helpful,0
the location is perfect for getting round seoul,0
would 100 recommend to a friend,0
the hostel is in a nice area with nice bars and restaurants around,0
not too far from the city centre on the public transport so location wasnt much of an issue,0
there wasnt much of an atmosphere but for the price it was fine,0
as we were travelling in a budget the kitchen was very useful too ,0
one of the best hotels i have been at ,0
amazing staff,0
danke 1,
no place to really hang out,0
this space is small ,0
2 room is too cramped with beds given price 3 i rested comfortably so i must say that most important 4 pillow was not really a pillow when i asked for another one i was told by an employee i am not on duty now,0
who is i asked,0
no one right now he responded ,0
5,
shower went on for 40 seconds then off and no more waterwhat was up with that ,0
6,
the internet would not allow me to make a call on whatsapp,0
best hostel i have been to in my whole trip and i didnt even plan to stay here,0
awesome people as well as great kitchen and foosball table people at the desk were also stars 1010,0
really good experience i would like to draw attention to the staff who were brilliant very welcoming ,0
rooms and amenities were spotless and a good offering for breakfast ,1
thank you very much,0
ive stayed here twice,0
its always been good,0
i think this is a great place to stay for quicker trips to paris as its close to the airport tram,0
not much of a social atmosphere but well connected to the city,0
was the filthiest hostel ive ever stayed in,1
sheets werent changed from the previous person,1
bathrooms were disgusting with mold everywhere and toilet wasnt cleaned for 2 days,1
awesome area for nightlife and bars,0
entire hostel was neat and tidy with all the facilities to suit our needs kitchen luggage room laundry room multiple bathrooms and showers,1
although we didnt have much interaction with the staff they were friendly and helpful whenever we had questions,0
a good place to stay for sure,0
the managerowner was great and the rooms were as described,0
the front door is open to outsiders,0
not a single taxi driver could find the place in less than an hour of aimless driving and asking for directions then giving up and calling the hotel,0
also four nearby hotels have similar name,0
24 hour reception includes 12 year old boy who cant help with much and doesnt speak english and needs to call manager who was asleep when i needed to get a taxi to the airport,0
wouldnt recommend,0
really nice and clean place with comfy beds,1
not too far from main attractions its a big hostel alot of people staying here with different age groups ,0
if you are a solo traveler you may consider it,0
but its not an ideal option,0
great hostel in the heart of toronto close to everything you could want and with its own little pub in the basement ,0
the team is super nice and activities largely free are organized every day,0
i had a great time and met many great people from around the world ,0
would definitely stay again,0
hostel was wonderful,0
staff was great and there was a very inclusive vibe,0
so its ideal for solo travelers,0
one of my best hostel stays yet,0
best hostel we ever stayed at,0
absolutely amazing,0
the place was great,0
awesome people staying there very friendly,0
there were no bag lockers,0
though there were safes for your valuables,0
its a bit far out of town but thats fine,0
overall very memorable stay,0
the staff was great and the bar had a great atmosphere to watch the game,0
unfortunately the room was extremely crammed and there wasnt a lot of space to place your items,0
my main concern was the heat in the room,0
while there were some floor fans anyone above the bottom bunk was miserably hot,0
not sure if theres any ac in the room,0
but i spent three hours sweating trying to fall asleep in the hot room,0
couldnt imagine a better experience,0
this hostel is just awesome,0
the location is so perfect its in a trendy area with heaps of turkish and middle eastern influence,0
its super easy to catch the metro into the main sights too,0
the staff are all lovely,0
the kitchen is well equipped and bathrooms are clean,1
theres good security and lockers are provided,0
really great atmosphere with mostly young guests common room is good for some drinks etc,0
cant recommend this place enough its really lovely,0
easy to go and see everything you wanted to see the beds were comfy and the rooms were clean,1
this place really isnt a hostel at all its a hotel,0
although it is well priced there is no place to socialize  i found the place to be pretty isolating most of the other guests were families or older couples so i really just dont see why this place is on website to begin with,0
when i checked in the staff seemed friendly but it turns out the guy who checked me in was just trying to sell me a vacation package,0
also the ac was broken  nobody would even came up to have a look at it,0
great hostel location is okay,0
best part is the lounge in the reception area where you can just sit and relax in couch,0
very good breakfast for 4 euros,0
and nice roof top bar to enjoy at night ,0
very clean and good rooms,1
only problem if i have to find is there are no common shower rooms and toilets which can be problem if you are staying in 6 bed dorms,0
apart from that one of good hostels i have been to ,0
the area was definitely a bit sketchy and i did not feel safe walking alone past 9pm in the area,0
the hostel itself has 24h reception and the staff is nice,0
rooms are great i stayed in a mixed dorm and every bed had a curtain outlet and light,0
showers were very clean ,1
however the atmosphere when i stayed wasnt great lots of young girls and older men hanging out in the bar,0
would only stay again if it was significantly cheaper than other hostels ,0
we only stayed for one night but we had such a great time here lian is such a welcoming host,0
we left wishing we had another few nights just because the hostel had such a nice vibe,0
definitely one of the best hostels ive stayed in,0
ideal place very friendly stuff and many interesting activities going on which makes it different from most hostels and one of the best places i have ever stayed in,0
you have the chance to learn how to cook japanese food participate in a tea ceremony there are guided tours music nights and plenty of opportunities to meet people,0
no ac and one small fan in a 10 bed dorm makes this a perfect winter and fall hostel not a summer one though,0
as well two showers were out of order so there was effectively one bathroom down in the basement area,0
not a bad hostel but not the best,0
great location though,0
you cannot sleep here,0
its next to a train line where 6 tracks meet together,0
enjoy hell,0
the stuffs at reception are great there are security guarding outside the hostel at the night ,0
people are friendly as well ,0
bed and others are fairly clean ,1
great hostel in total ,0
a nice stay ,0
cant fault the hostel facilities too much ,0
location was great ,0
unfortunately there were many loud school groups that congregated in common areas ,0
luggage storage the following day was good although they declined us to have a shower before catching the night bus which was a bit disappointing,0
rude staff elevator not working non helpful staff to help with baggage,0
i have a health condition and couldnt physically carry my things up 3 flights of stairs i booked this hostel specifically because they have lift access,0
the staff member said i looked healthy enough to lift them myself which was disgusting ,0
also blood on my bed and cleaners refused to do anything about it and told me to cover it with a sheet,1
great hostel  the staff were very friendly the location was excellent and the common areas exceeded our expectations,0
we booked a twin room which we didnt realise would be a bunk bed  we could have used a little more space,0
however as long as you know this its a cool place to stay,0
loved it ,0
stayed in 6 room all girls,0
had a little kicten connected to the room love my time here,0
eveyone was nice and clean great if your alone and wanna meet ppl,1
by far the worst hostel i stayed at in china,0
staff are incredibly rude facilities are average and the wifi is almost unexistant,0
take your money somewhere closer to tiananmen square,0
this place is awful,0
this is a good hostel in a beautiful building,0
the rooms have a lot of charm,0
and i really appreciated the free breakfast which hardly any hostels ever have,0
they were doing some construction during my stay and throughout the day men would come into our allfemale room,0
also we had to share three outlets between 18 girls,0
but all in all staff if nice especially lucas who was patient with me extending my stay multiple times,0
not the cleanest place in the world,1
opted out of showering and wished id booked somewhere a bit nicer,1
good for a quick overnight on a budget though,0
its good but i rest at 4th floor  but no lift not good for big bag ,0
good clean and good sleep,1
may be come back again,0
not far from subway,0
if your traveling from england or anywhere on a budget stop searchingðŸ˜‚ this place is chill and all the people are nice and accommodating,0
plus there is are cheap restaurants all up the street so you can get dinner for less than Â£1,0
the location was perfect,0
5 minute walk to the underground and 8 minute walk to shopping on oxford street ,0
the hostel itself was mediocre,0
the bathroom was awful and im not picky about cleanliness,1
location of power outlets were inconvenient only on the bedpost  so if you needed to use anything while it was charging you had to sit on your top bunk to do so ,0
also zero common rooms to socialize and meet people from outside your room,0
very nice and helpful staff,0
neat roomssocial areas,0
helpful all the time,0
location a little bit out but it is ok if you use day pass for the transportation,0
walk to the senjo temple and ueno park which is a bonus,0
highly recommend,0
big room hostel with a chill vibe,0
beers at the hostel are good,0
location is right next to the metro and lots of food around,0
but its a little sketchy and not a particularly interesting area,0
please stay at plus,0
hostel by all means,0
i tried their hostel chains in berlin and florence,0
love both hostels,0
the rooms were clean and the staff were helpful berlins one,1
with hostel price you get hotel facilities like sauna swimming pool and gym,0
i would have stay at plus prague if only the location is closer to the main areas,0
great vibes for a hostel bar was good fun and people everywhere,0
bathrooms could stand to be cleaned a little more regularly and where incredibly hot with little to no ventilation,1
staff really helpful and friendly,0
rooms are tiny though we travelled europe for 6 weeks and stayed hostels almost everywhere we went we had a three bed private and the room was by far the smallest we stayed in,0
almost impossible for everyone to try and get in their bags and dress at the same time,0
in general it is a good hostel,0
one lady of the reception behaved very bad with us she was totally rude,0
class hostel located on the east side of berlin so a metro was required to take you to some of the more touristy areas but the east side gallery is literally on your doorstep,0
swimming pool was under renovation so didnt get to use that but,0
the bar and restaurant were really good,0
15 euro minimum spend on card could be lower but didnt really affect us,0
really good hostel though and would definitely stay here again,0
we had a wonderful stay at the plug inn hostel in paris ,0
the staff and security were awesome ,0
extremely friendly and multilingual staff upon arrival,0
the rooms were very clean and efficient,1
the place as a whole was adorable and fun and they offer daily historical tours and nightly bar crawls,0
would easily stay there again if i return to berlin,0
nice place to stay at,0
the rooms are quite big but the bunk beds are not that spacious although they do have a lamp 2 charging ports and 2 outlets,0
the toilets and showers are cleaned regularly and are better than most hostels,1
has a nice area downstairs for watching tv and eating food,0
they also have a pretty great luggage storage policy that saved me a lot of hassle and the staff are extremely helpful,0
the locations is not the best but you can easily take a bus to the city center,0
the generator mitte is a really good hostel,0
but its really a pain to stay in this one â?¢,0
the people staying there for fun are absolutely devoid of any sense of respect for the others they shout they singâ??,0
basically they make a lot of noise and they act like total teenagers,0
well to be honest a lot of them are teenagersâ?? ,0
â?¢ its dirty,1
the rooms are okay but the toilets are awful ,1
â?¢ therere no plugs near the beds no individual lampsâ??,0
i stayed in the womens dorm and it was clean and quiet and well laid out,1
there was a security box not big enough for a laptop but good for everything else,0
shampoo soap and conditioner are provided in the showers,0
small towels and other linens are provided,0
staff was friendly and theres a cute coffee shop in the lobby,0
location and cleanliness are key,1
it was my first time staying at any hostel went with this one since it is central to a lot of tourist places and it is very close to the london undergroundoverall its a great place to stay only thing i will say is that the elevator is still not working so you have to climb the stairs with your luggage it can get tiring if you are on the top floor like i was other than that it was a great experience,0
theres not really a kitchen area so you wont be able to cook and there isnt even a place to get water except the one sink in the bedroom,0
the area is also pretty sketchyfine for during the day,0
but i made the mistake of walking home late at night and would recommend others dont,0
other than that nice hostel,0
good place to meet lots of people,0
cant complain,0
this place was great,0
the people and staff were fun,0
wish i had been in london for longer,0
so i could have stayed here more nights,0
my stay was awesome and i really like this place ,0
always a good stay here such a clean and friendly hostel with good facilities and great location,1
good hostel,0
very central and close to the subway station,0
the staff was by the far best thing about this,0
they were very helpful and managed to organise a room for me earlier,0
11hrs on an overnight train without any sleep,0
one of the smaller hostels i have stayed at but always something to do around it,0
very safe and secure as you needed a key to actually get in,0
most expensive of my china trip,0
but thats beijing for you,0
would definitely recommend and would stay here again,0
good place to stay near sacre coer on a budget,0
everything was smooth and easy,0
very nice accommodations but the rooms are very hot,0
the hostel provides some fans but they arent quite enough,0
and opening the window is very noisy from the bar in the courtyard,0
everyone was very friendly though and the hostel is quite lively,0
my only complaint is how expense extras are,0
beer is not very cheap at the bar and if you want to buy flip flops or a lock the prices are quite high,0
also because its sort of a party hostel people will puke in the bathrooms every morning,0
overall fantastic place to stay that really lives up to its name,0
super convenient location for the hongdae area and also super close to the hongik subway station,0
the staff and other travelers were super friendly and really made the trip a great time,0
i would definitely recommend the stay,0
nice atmosphere in the lobby and every one was very friendly all the cooking facilities you need however the wifi was awful and only really worked in the lobby,0
would stay again as great value,0
great location within a short walking distance of everything ,0
the building and the rooms are colorful modern and regularly cleaned which is a very important for a hostel ,0
the staff was very kind and super helpful when needed  ,0
we had the breakfast included in the price  buffet with a large choice of cereals cookies and beverages,0
very good ,0
moreover you can upgrade to the english breakfast for 1?£ to make a long story short i highly recommend this place for your trip to london ,0
the location was really good close to the tube and oxford circus,0
the people at the reception were very helpful,0
however it was not very clean which was very sad ,1
especially the bath,0
i asked them several times to clean the sink which they didnt,1
not even the bin was emptied it kept getting fuller and fuller,1
thankfully i was in a room with girls who were considerate and tried to keep the room clean,1
and there is no wifi in the rooms and no usb ports,0
so you have to buy an adapter,0
it was a weird mix between party hostel and a family hotel  i couldnt quite figure out which it was,0
the restaurantbar was a cool place to hang out and had good food,0
you find few washrooms,0
fantastic place,0
really cool and big hostel with a great bar,0
clean rooms and clean facilities,1
friendly staff at all hours who help you with any question,0
nice place to stay bonus it has ac in every room reception staff were not very friendly,0
room was clean n tidy small ensuite,1
the hostel let some one change room in to ours at like 3 am which woke everyone up with him moving all imhos things in,0
neat and clean place to stay,1
additionally having a local barpub in the same building adds a lot of character and fun to the place,0
the place got music atleast on friday and saturday so that does takes thing up a notch,0
there are enough eating places and 711 close by and connectivity to multiple stations which makes commuting very easy,0
location is great if you have a jr pass but not so great if youre going out to roppongi or shinjuku for nightlife,0
would not recommend for solo travellers since there are a lot of school groups families businessmen and older people,0
great hostel,0
wifi works well,0
arrived after a long journey from seattle,0
curtains in the bunks allow you sleep or nap any time of the day,0
i took the walking tour  had a great time,0
would definitely come back,0
the restrooms were disgusting and there was children running around which didnt make it very comfortable for the actual backpackerstravelers,1
the common rooms close at 12pm which are the only places you can charge your electronics,0
there are no ports in the rooms,0
i stayed in the 33bed,0
you also have no storage in the room and are forced to pay 3 pounds everytime you open it for a locker if you want to keep your stuff from being pinched,0
but the staff was very friendly,0
great pizza place just a few doors down,0
rented bikes for the day which made our experience much better and we could get them from the hostel as well which was even easier,0
booked a private room,0
great space,0
so nice to not have to share a bathroom or shower,0
beds were comfortable,0
location seemed a bit out there but the train station was super close so wasnt an issue,0
neighbourhood was great,0
i felt safe walking around at night by myself,0
i enjoyed my stay here,0
beautiful building and great location for exploring montmartre,0
not much of an atmosphere but still a fun place to stay due to location,0
near metro lines so there is flexibility as well,0
decent hostel,0
very nice people and nice common area but somewhat of a suffocating atmosphere,0
no ac and very low ceilings and their lift was broken,0
and the rooms are packed and claustrophobic,0
but still great experience good location good beer great people,0
the hostel is located a couple of minutes from a metro station and 10 minutes from sacre coeur,0
the beds were comfortable but there was not enough plugs in the room we had to take it in turns to charge our phones,0
there was just 2 plugs in a 6 bed dorm,0
overall i was happy with the hostel and would stay again next time i visit paris,0
may meet some small insects in the room,0
i didnt see them  but after one night sleeping i got some bites,0
the room location and staff were all lovely however the room had a very strong smell which did not fade over our stay ,0
unfortunately the smell was very unpleasant and so slightly tainted our stay,1
otherwise the bar below and the rest of the hostel was fab,0
overall st james is a great hostel for a budget traveler,0
the free breakfast and dinners are amazing and really let you save money to seedo more things in london,0
the bathroom facilities are often cleaned and the bedrooms have nice big windows that allow for air movement,1
the staff is made up of young adults from different countries that come to london to work in a hostel setting,0
theyre learning  so just remember to be patient with them,0
great choice for a great trip in london,0
perfect location rooms clean and each bed has charging sockets curtain for privacy and a cage under the bed to lock away personal items,1
communal laundry facilities and microwave etc available ,0
in future id take my own padlock for locking items in the cage and washing powder for the machine as adding these items on at the hostel becomes more price than needed ,0
second time ive stayed here and would definitely recommend and return ,0
wombats hostel is consistent everywhere,0
i have stayed at the one in london and the one in berlin had the same amenities as well as consistently clean,1
the only slight complaint is topdeck came in and killed the solo backpacker vibe in the bar,0
i hung in the lounge some mainly bc the whole group flocked to the bar often and loudly,0
but that is out of wombats hands,0
the lounge still made for a nice place to chill and chat,0
such a clean secure and well managed hostel ,1
its not the best place to stay if you want to meet people outside of your room ,0
however the location is good the toilet paper is great a very underappreciated hostel quality and the kitchen is massive as well if you want to cook a meal ,0
this place is a great value for the price,0
grear place,0
 this hostile had a great feel to it,0
we were unable to check in for several hours because the system was down,0
and we did find bugs in our pizza,0
every time we went up on the terrace we were told we couldnt get a drink,0
or it was not open,0
and we went during the times,0
it was supposed to be open,0
may be a more efficient check in system would be more helpful too,0
we went through checkin process twice for each night we were there,0
maybe it could all be done in one moment to speed things up,0
at,0
very calm place and theres a metro station very near,0
but  there was only 1 key proom so the room would be open the entire night since someone could arrive and be locked outside ,0
 apparently everything was clean but i saw a rat passing by the main room where we have breakfast so i dont know ,1
,
 the bathroom light turns off while youre on the shower,0
the wifi has absolutely no sign at the room,0
you shouldnt say theres wifi when you actually have to go to the reception to use it,0
fantastic hostel good location where its a little bit quieter than shibuya or shinjuku but easy to reach those areas,0
staff fantastic and having the bar and cafe in the building was an added bonus,0
100 one of the best hostels ive ever been to,0
the air conditioner and the location is really bad ,0
other than that i think everything is fine,0
this place was wonderful,0
the staff was very friendly and helpful,0
first time in torontocanada,0
and they were able to guide me in the right direction,0
i usually do not write reviews but i had an absolutely phenomenal time at whitetail,0
the location is unbeatable in an artsy district near a university and the building itself was clean and secure electronic codes so no losing keys,0
i traveled solo to seoul and was quickly introduced to an inclusive and fun community,0
the staff went above and beyond to ensure everyones needs were met and the quality is good for the price in the 5 person dorm,0
i wish i could have stayed longer,0
i really enjoyed my stay here,0
the manager sabrina is extremely friendly and helpful,0
i was traveling alone but able to make a few friends at the hostel,0
so i had some people to go out and eat with,0
the location has very convenient access to a train station that goes directly to the airport and the neighborhood is full of fun things to see and do and eat,0
i have no complaints about this place and will probably stay here again in the future,0
great hostel friendly staff with an excellent pub,0
right in the middle of camden so really close to the market and great bars and shops,0
i had the top bunk in a 4 person dorm on a higher floor  was absolutely miserable,0
no ventilation at all,0
the bunk had a ledge on the side where you could put stuff mine was so full of dust bunnies,1
not even just a little  a lot,0
my allergies were so terrible i could not breathe or sleep at all,0
i was supposed to stay for 6 nights but booked a hotel by 5 am my 1st night there,0
plugs far away from beds showers smelled mattresses that popped when i moved the bedside wall was dirty,1
ewww,0
only stayed 1 night as a stopover but seems pretty nice overall,0
not super clean but fine for 1 night,1
nice kitchen facilities,0
beds arent the most comfortable,0
location was good  heaps of food places around the area,0
super fun and social hostel right near camden,0
the atmosphere is amazing for meeting other travelers and the bar downstairsfamily dinners are a ton of fun,0
only downside was that it was a little far from the city center but easily accessible by the tube,0
also wasnt the cleanest of hostels i have stayed out,1
would definitely recommend though,0
fking amazing hostel,0
the place is near the train station hongik univ exit 9 which makes it convenient for travellers to roam around the city,0
but the rooms are on the fourth floor you might want to note that especially if youre planning to pack your itinerary per day which means a loooooot of walking,0
going up to the fourth floor after a tiring day is the least thing youd want to do,0
unless that doesnt bother you id recommend dustin guesthouse ,0
dont stay here there is no ac and the rooms are disgustingly hot even though its cold outside,0
also the roomsbathrooms arent clean,1
probably one of the worst hostel experiences ive had,0
fantastic,0
the location the place the roomates,0
great 6 bed mix,0
traveled with my girlfriend and was skeptical of it but the room was spacious and our roommates were great,0
would stay again,0
great place and friendly staff but the showers and washrooms are a bit scary,0
the saying goes low expectations and you cant be disappointed,0
anyway i had low expectations and i was still very disappointed,0
in my time i have stayed in some questionable places but this topped the lot,0
ive never felt so dirty and uncomfortable,1
the highlight being the trail of blood found in the male bathroom which remained for some hours,1
while the social area is decent enough the apparent understaffing and distinct lack of self respect of the place by all involved is shocking,0
sos,0
someone who has tried hostels like generator and fiap will surely have different standards to compare it with,0
let me share some problems with you which i faced at bvj and that too when i was there just for a night ,0
1,0
wifi doesnt work in rooms,0
you have to sit in the lobby area to access it 2,0
there are no washrooms inside the rooms,0
not even a loo 3,0
no privacy for female dorms 4,0
they dont have automated billing system,0
they write the bill for you on a piece of paper and accept only cash,0
this was a really nice place to stay,0
we had issues with plumbing late at night but staff was able to help us very quickly,0
the heat wave is killer so more fans in our room 16 person room would have been nice,0
overall safe and the people were friendly,0
pretty poor accom for the money not overly happy,0
people there are amazing,0
friendly environment,0
very helpful,0
bathrooms were super clean,1
amazing party hostel,0
the bar is unreal with crazy bartenders,0
so much fun,0
kind of in a rough area and a bit outside the city centre but right next to a central metro station,0
love that the beds all have privacy curtains,0
the hostel was alright but it could be great if they had lockers in the rooms more powerpoints and not the cheapest toilet paper on earth apart from that great location and beautiful rooms and stay,0
great hostel,0
location was great,0
its very close to the metro line 3,0
it wasnt in paris city center but very close to it,0
i would stay here again,0
rooms were clean and decent sizes private ensuite,1
not sure about dorms,0
the staff was also very friendly,0
luggage storage was great as we got to spend the early part of the day around paris before catching our train,0
an incredible find for the price,0
the location is convenient sitting right next to mornington crescent station and a short walk from kings cross,0
the interior is well furnished clean and quiet,1
pia and mark were helpful and responsive  be aware that communication may be through whatsapp,0
if i ever revisit london alone i know where i will be staying,0
the hostel itself was great the breakfast was reasonably priced 4?£ free if you book directly through them and the metro is so close that its not a problem but if youre looking to drink and explore the area after hours its extremely sketchy at night which is probably why they have a bar but that bar is limited and the atmosphere varies,0
i just stayed at joeys for half a day before my flight back home,0
the staff including cherry and josh in particular was just adorable,0
i paid less because i didnt use the bed but used the shower facilities,0
the common spaces are very nice and homy it is easy to meet people and the hostel is very well located near many markets and the subway,0
i really recommend this hostel for travellers passing by delhi,0
one of the best hostels in central london,0
easy to locate,0
clean room and bathroom,1
friendly staff,0
one thing is that there are only few cafe or restaurant nearby,0
but of course you can use their kitchen,0
had to change rooms because of street noise and overall hostel roommates who talked all night,0
would not recommend for people who want at least 4 hours of continuous sleep,0
also lots of notes regarding having sex in dorms and how its prohibited,0
but its not like the security checks for people who dont belong there in fact i saw how they let their friends in at night without hesitation,0
not very safe and beds are uncomfortable and lumpy possibly even have human dna if you catch my drift,1
the hostel appears to be a little old overall cleanliness in the common toilet can be improved,1
the location is good 10 min walk from kings cross,0
the smell is awful both in showers and in dorms,1
there isnt much space in rooms as well,0
you do have a locker,0
but you either need a personal padlock,0
or you have to buy one at the reception,0
so yeah that is for security ,0
breakfast is good and it costs you 2?£,0
the problem is the fact that you have to eat this breakfast and pay or you can wait till 1pm to use the kitchen ,0
this is a very cool hostel,0
loved the common rooms living room patio kitchen are all perfect and the affordable downstairs bar and coffee shop,0
everything is beautifully artistic decorated and the staff is very friendly,0
it was easy to meet others,0
the downside is no outside alcohol in the building because of the bar and noisy screetchy bunks in the 8 bed dorm along with some snoring men that made it hard to sleep  ear plugs did help  all in all we really loved this awesome hostel,0
overall great stay,0
we chose a room with an ensuite to avoid the shared shower situation we saw in other reviews,0
would avoid checking in at three because there are very long queues,0
but other than that no complaints,0
the rooms were a decent size however the lock on the bathroom didnt lock,0
in my opinion the best thing about this hotel is the staff,0
they were always incredibly cheerful and happy to help their guests,0
the facilities decor and atmosphere in this hostel are all amazing,0
the rooms are spacious extremely clean and well air conditioned,0
the kitchen is also large and has all utensils necessary,0
the staff are very friendly and went out of their way to help where possible,0
the hostel is a bit out from central berlin however it is a short walk from a metro station which carries you straight to the city,0
would definitely stay in this hostel again and highly recommend,0
hostel has air conditioning and will store your luggage for you even after check out for a fee,0
very close to major transport and lots of food options,0
fyi towels are not included,0
absolutely wonderful im a woman traveling by herself and i was in a mixed dorm and even then i felt comfortable,0
i highly recommend,0
great food great beds everything was above and beyond,0
the staff here just make you feel so welcome and looked after that its well worth staying at,0
you get what you pay for  but for no cheaper hostel in tokyo its not a bad deal,0
as long as youre not overly ocd about cleanliness and dont mind a 15 min walk to the station to get the train to the major areas it only takes about 30 mins when on the train then definitely stay here to save money and be well looked after,1
great hostel,0
right next to the east side gallery,0
big spacious rooms at a super reasonable price,0
will definitely recommend to stay here,0
convenient 3 day stay,0
friendly and helpful reception,0
the restaurant food is great and so is the bar ,0
wifi is reliable,0
highly recommended if you looking for low budget accommodation,0
wonderful stay supreme location and best hostel breakfast ive ever had,0
staff was not knowledgeable about tours  activities,0
there were too few staff it was timeconsuming to find someone to speak to poor facilities,0
no lounge no kitchen nowhere to drink ones own alcohol or eat ones own food no book exchange no computers for guests to use towels not provided,0
room was too hot no air con,0
only had a broken fan ,0
housekeeping did not enter our room once this meant no clean towels full bin no tea etc ,1
 paid for a private room room was tiny and bathroom is basically a portaloo ,0
 no kitchen in the hostel,0
pretty below average breakfast options ,0
when checking out mentioned the housekeeping issue with a staff member and she said there was nothing she could do maybe a refund for the housekeeping charge,0
or at least vouchers for food ,0
comfiest beds in japan so far,0
a really lovely place staff are so warm and friendly and the location is excellent,0
i only left because im travelling indefinitely and found somewhere down the road thats a bit cheaper,0
if the prices come down after the peak season ill be heading back,0
there are organised events almost every day like free dinner or a rallye around town,0
breakfast is 1?£ which goes to charity,0
the staff was amazing always very nice and helpful ,0
rooms and facilities werent always completely clean and the hostel has a very strickt nofood policy in the rooms which means that the staff controlled our room while we werent there,1
and then we had to take out our fruitinfused water even though the bottles were still closed,0
the area is not the best at night,0
but its a great hostel ,0
would do it again for sure,0
perfect location clean bathrooms and spacious rooms,1
id recommend staying here,0
i had an excellent time here,0
staff were friendly informative and helpful,0
security was excellent and made you feel safe,0
overall a good stay,0
this is a great hostel for paris  the bathrooms are large beds comfy and the staff is very friendly,0
however i find it completley unreasonable that you arent allowed to use the kitchen between 7am and 12pm,0
their breakfast option is an absolute waste of money its what id expect of a free breakfast nothing more so its dissaponting that they dont give people the option to ever grab some basic items from the fridge that theyve purchased from the supermarket,0
they need to reconsider this,0
great hostel,0
close to the tcat which is really ideal if youre in tokyo for a layover like i was,0
would stay here again,0
the room was at 5th level to take the luggage on that level was indeed a pain,0
plus the washrooms were very tiny ,0
staff were awesome and so are the atmosphere,0
i stayed here only for one night,0
great location for me as i had a train to catch from st pancras station the next day which is only walk away,0
atmosphere was a bit off,0
none of the other stayers seemed very social spent a lot of time in the dorm on their bed,0
hostel as a whole was good though clean good value for money and friendlyhelpful staff,1
basically great,0
i would recommend this place to anyone,0
was a great hostel,0
good hostel for how big it is great location by borough market at night theres music and dance floor nice friendly staff,0
 pros one of the staff helped us order dinner by phone because our sim wasnt working,0
another guy sorry weve forgotten your name,0
was really helpful once we checked out w ordering an uber to the train and gave us good tips ,0
cons shower,0
didnt work dirty bed sheets dorm nowhere near as big as appears in pictures  pretty cramped one guest got very drunk with the staff and threw up in the hall and bathroom and staff only cleaned up the hall under pressure,1
would not recommend,0
an allround great experience,0
i met some really great travelers while at the bar on the main floor,0
the staff is great the facilities were clean and the free walking tour was great,1
if i ever go back to paris ill probably stay again,0
this hostel is amazing,0
the staff is incredibly friendly and will know you by name by the time you leave,0
the provided dinners are delicious and a great way to meet other people and the staff plans activities every day,0
this is an amazing hostel for solo travelers,0
the friendly atmosphere causes you to be able to meet essentially everyone in the hostel so it feels very safe,0
it is a little far from the touristy things but you can reach them by tube or bus,0
i hope i can come back through soon,0
its good value for your money,0
its far from a lot of the main attractions that paris has to offer but the train station is close by,0
the neighborhood is not very good but the hostel is safe,0
the main issue is that paris is hot in the summer and there is no ac in the rooms,0
if you are ready to sweat while sleeping or not sleeping at all then this is the place to be,0
really though its worth sucking it up a night or two,0
beautiful terrace space with in house activities like karaoke night and game night just makes your stay wonderful,0
staff are helpful and have good local area knowledge,0
this place is a dump,0
everything is so worn down that i am surprised they allow people to stay here,0
i stayed in the big room out back thats not even attached to the building,0
they squeezed as many bunk beds in that room,0
the sheets were ripped and the pillows were so flat,0
there was a big crew that came and they didnt even have the beds organized for them and when they asked for new sheets the female worker gave her attitude and said no,0
then another girl got her coins stolen from her ???¡,0
great hostel very friendly and helpful staff clean bathrooms and rooms,1
its a bit far from the sights by foot but you can take the metro which is pretty close ,0
suggestion for the administration install air conditioner or ventilators in rooms as it gets way too hot during summers and the windows can barely be opened,0
bathroom was frustrating to use,0
all of the shower and sink faucets automatically shut off after just a few seconds which is annoying,0
lots of leftover stuff from previous guests scattered about,0
would not stay at again,0
facilities are small but clean enough ,1
staff is friendly and helpful ,0
breakfast is unlimited in quantity and it is classic continental good enough,0
beds are comfy ,0
oh i really liked a console of plugs at every bed,0
eu uk usb and a night lamp ,0
its an alright place to stay if you dont mind too loud music down in the bad and hearing beats in the rooms upstairs to about 2am ,0
overall i think it is ok place to stay for a couple of nights its a hostel so keep your expectations in check,0
i cant really think of anything good to say about this place,0
the staff is unhelpful and unfriendly,0
the beds are noisy and uncomfortable and the room was a literal sauna,0
one of the worst hostel experiences ive had and ive had hundreds,0
go somewhere else,0
this hostel was fine,0
its cheap and close to the station which makes it easy for a day or two,0
there is no real vibe here besides the place looking cool its very much a city hostel and doesnt seem to have any warmth about it,0
its totally fine if you are out and about and busy in the city beds are comfy heaps of bathrooms and in a good spot,0
just not quite the same experience as other hostels in japan,0
the hostel was great,0
but i was unlucky to have a very noisy couple of people in my dorm including an american couple of pornstars apparently,0
didnt get much sleep,0
we had a great time staying here,0
the staff were all very friendly and lovely and once we arrived here we were a bit reluctant to leave because of the brilliant atmosphere,0
the beds were very comfy and we got a nice breakfast in the morning,0
if i were to go to london again i would choose this place again,0
we stayed at other st christophers before and have had no real problems before but this one was understaffed or underprepared for the middle of summer,0
the staff seemed shocked that the place was booked out and used that as the excuse for why our rooms were filthy and uncleaned at check in time though when they were finally cleaned it was to the good standard of st christophers,1
everything else was fine though the breakfast has gone downhill warm milk dirty plates bit of a let down,0
nice basic place in delhi clean bathrooms,1
rooftop is good just needs more chairs,0
its a clean nice place and the wifi works great and its in a really good location but theres no atmosphere whatsoever,1
because its so big and has more of a hotel like feel to it people really keep to themselves,0
the walking tour is your best bet for meeting people,0
and the kitchen should have at least salt and oil in it because when youre backpacking you dont really want to buy and carry that stuff with you just saying,0
very well located and cheap hostel ,0
 great wifi decent beddings reception open 24h  lack of warm water,0
the morning guy was extremely nice,0
nice place to stay in the city if you are visiting,0
 its very near one of the best places to have fun around seoul hongdae,0
the hosts are very nice and helpful and the facilities are pretty good considering the price,0
good atmosphere in general,0
nice and traditional hostel,0
to be honest staff was great and very helpful since i crossed the door,0
however it could improve with better facilities like common room and kitchen,0
do not go to this hostel if you want to rest due to live music which i really enjoyed lol,0
pros felt safe clean secure we loved the privacy curtains for the sake of our sleep and others,0
the immediate area seems a little sketchy but as we explored we found hidden gems,0
the market on friday morning was very affordable and delicious ,0
cons,0
most people seemed to be on their phones and there was very little social atmosphere the exception being the roof terrace  which had stunning views of the eiffel tower and the sacr?? cÅ?ur which even then was a little divided,0
perfect for what i needed,0
it was cheap easy to find friendly staff  particularly the night watch bar staff good luck with your comedy gigs,0
really loved the roof top bar,0
made it very easy to socialise,0
room was clean and staff friendly,0
great hostel,0
good party vibe good facilities and clean,1
great location cool vibe and very good breakfast,0
really nice staff,0
i will repeat with them if i come back to pekin,0
thanks,0
really good location  was only a 1 minute walk from the metro which was only a few stops to the city centre,0
great facilities however lack of a kitchen was a pain but cheap restaurants were not too hard to find,0
i found the social scene was a little exclusive as a solo traveller but may have just been the people there when i stayed,0
overall really good,0
awesome place to stay,0
my flight was delayed and they handled my 3am check in with no problem at all ,0
id stay there again in a heartbeat,0
wonderful place to stay pleasant walk through a park to get to the train station,0
no stress checkin,0
hostess was very sweet and helpful,0
spoke good english which was a plus,0
would recommend for anyone looking for a great budget place,0
loved my experience at this hostel,0
it was very clean and the rooms were nice,1
they had fun activities to participate in make your own crepes and fun entertainment in the bar,0
however i would not recommend this hostel for anyone that does not like noise,0
since they have a great bar you can often hear it from your room at night,0
this wasnt an issue for me,0
but i know it bothered some,0
i would definitely tell people to stay here and would go again,0
had a super time,0
great atmosphere created by the irish girl with the curls niamh,0
she was very helpful and even more fun,0
good value bar prices too,0
a nice place to stay directly next to the gare du nord train station,0
only problems were the staff was not as helpful as we wouldve liked them to be asked for a recommendation on a place to eat nearby at about 11am and they told us everything in the area would be closed but there were several cafes that were open right across the street and there was black mold growing on the ceiling in the bathroom dont have to touch the ceiling,1
so it didnt bother us much,0
room was small but fine,0
the lobby area was nice but the room was dark very cramped and not super clean mattresses had stains,1
the staff were so so so friendlykind,0
the location is fine because its close to the ubahn and 10 to 15 min walk to sbahn but is a bit far away from popular neighborhoods like mitte kreuzberg friedrichshain,0
overall good experience,0
location is good walkable to most things if youre like me and walk most cities instead of metro,0
had ac but was still unbearably hot especially the second night,0
very good staff,0
good vibe and pretty social atmosphere,0
loved the privacy curtains on the beds,0
just a heads up,0
book this hostel direct and you can get free breakfast instead of through hostel world and then having to pay ,0
dont stay there if you dont have to,0
you can see any kind of insects such as spiders,0
beds are not well and clean,1
its not a traveller hostel,0
youll see people came from other countries and working and trying to live in london,0
no plugs for beds,0
i dont suggest you to leave your phone away,0
no ac,0
8 people and small window,0
its close to the central london,0
its a cheap place makes you not a homeless but dont come here for holidays guys,0
dont stay there if you dont have to,0
having somewhere welcoming and in the centre of the hongdae district was really amazing,0
the staff were helpful the few times i needed help and it had the great vibe you want from a hostel with friendly guests and people willing to go out and do stuff,0
will definitely come back when i come back to seoul,0
staff are helpful,0
dorm room is cramped,0
kitchen is nice,0
downstairs restaurant is a lovely area,0
security is good,0
an okay place,0
but for the price it could really do better,0
this was a good place to stay,0
they provided a video exactly of how to get there from the airport which is a really nice touch ,0
dj is so nice and helpful and cooked an amazing lunch for all the guests,0
the common area is very squished and the dorm rooms are right off of the common room,0
so it could be difficult to sleep if people were hanging out in the common area,0
most of the books were manga or outdated travel books,0
the place has its own bar and the atmosphere is nice,0
it looks like a party hostel where you can easily meet travelers and have fun but not the kind where you have to be afraid of people ending up overly drunk in your bed,0
i stayed a couple days only and chose to just rest and see the city managing to do so without any trouble,0
very well organized and clean,1
not clean,1
bad breakfast,0
the staff dont know to answer questions about tourist staff,0
location was great in good silence place will not come back,0
we only stayed overnight as we were catching a train out the next day,0
the rooms were spacious  had baskets underneath the bunks to lock your things away,0
beds werent too bad,0
located in a nice area public transport only a 5 minute walk,0
overall was a very nice clean friendly hostel,1
the location is good but the place is weird,0
they dont let you go into your room from 113 which is super super annoying if youre staying for more than a night,0
the wifi if horrible,0
 it was boiling hot and the room of 6 only had one fan that the person nearest too would just turn it around and point it at themselves,0
basically woke up in a pool of sweat thinking id wet myself,0
the atmosphere of this place is definitely weird and forced,0
a bunch of people who dont know how to make plans,0
so they expect the hostel to make plans for them,0
wifi could barely be used which many international travelers rely on,0
facilities need an upgrade as the shower water would rocket from ice cold to scalding hot without prompt and there was no way to avoid this water as the shower is so confined shower space was less than 1m,0
x 1m or 1yd x,0
1yd,0
rooms were cramped with little storage space and incredibly hot in the summer months ,0
despite this the staff was excellent,0
very friendly and happy to help,0
the location also could not be beat,0
great hostel,0
would stay again,0
big hostel vibe,0
standard largesized lockers,0
very very clean,1
free shampoo and towels,0
karaoke is hella fun,0
nishiarai seems a bit further away from central tokyo than id like but metro is close so its really no big deal,0
staff are cool and nice and host cool event but very professional and not the lets get drunk together type,0
good hostel to base out of tokyo though,0
we had an excellent stay and the staff even gave us a free upgrade on our room ,0
the room was clean but not spotless,1
we definitely felt like it was a safesecure place in an excellent location near barsrestaurantspublic transit,0
expect to pay for any extras,0
but id say that for instance the breakfast was excellent and at a good price ,0
the music from the barcourtyard was a bit excessively loud and was a bit bothersome at night but they eventually shut the music down at around midnight,0
hostel is fine,0
cairo is a dirty city where everyone tries to sell you something,0
the staff is very nice and helpful,0
they answer all my questions nicely,0
location is ok with public transport,0
the kitchen is spacious and i cook most of the time,0
recommended,0
i loved the stay here,0
the room is small but all i was doing was sleeping there to be honest,0
the beds were hard but i slept well enough,0
the location is incredible,0
right in the middle of myeongdong and so close to the subway and bus stations,0
the staff were so great and helpful with anything i needed,0
i would stay here again for sure,0
i stayed at hostel enishi for 1 night on a 2 day trip to tokyo,0
the hostel was very pretty and cleanly organized inside,0
the staff were friendly and helpful and i would definitely consider coming back to the hostel if i play to travel around shibuya,0
the location is not close to shibuya but you can get there on a subway that is not far from the hostel,0
it is a good place for the price,0
really glad that i chose this place as my hostel,0
would definitely recommend,0
great spot,0
location is a bit out of the way but london is so big it is almost hard to find somewhere to stay that you wont have to walk or take the tub to,0
very clean facility probably one of the nicest hostels i have ever stayed in and the bar had a good atmosphere,1
bathrooms flooded multiple times rooms were boiling and showers left much to be desired,0
pros good location ok price clean bed small hostel so good for making friends cons not very clean especially the floors bring socks,1
short reception hours i felt like i was bothering reception when asking questions and they kept turning the air conditioning off,0
theres lots of rules here and they will be enforced,0
i had a pleasant and enjoyable experience staying in baxpax downtown hostel,0
the staff were friendly and quite efficient,0
the facilities in the hostel were good but they could be improved in some areas,0
the dorm rooms in k studio was lacking basic seating despite plenty of available room to manoeuvre,0
the lounge games room could do with more seating because the sofa and chairs were taken at busy times,0
there is sometimes a big queue to use the washing machine and tumble dryer so do plan ahead,0
this hostel has a great lovation,0
it is near metro and beautiful montmartre,0
our room and bathroom were cleand everyday,1
hostel has a nice kitchen outdoor area and luggage storage that you can use after you check out,0
the staff was very friendly and helpful,0
overall i would recommend this hostel,0
wombats is a great place to stay,0
the staff is excellent and very helpful,0
the atmosphere in the hostel is great the rooms and bathrooms are very clean and tidy,1
definitely recommend this hostel to anyone traveling to london,0
one of the best hostels ive stayed at ever,0
big hostel big rooms big lounge good breakfast laundry service its secure and clean,1
also it is located near to some of the most important historical points in berlin topographie des terrors jewish museum etc,0
there are bus stops just in front of the hostel and a couple of metro stations just few minutes walking,0
the atmosphere at this hostel is just amazing and its extremely safe for solo female travelers,0
the staff goes beyond their means to help you out with anything you ask for,0
i highly recommend this place,0
i had a good stay at this small but nice hostel,0
the free breakfast was decent and the bed made for a good sleep slept in a 4bed dorm,0
rooms were really hot but then again it was 30 outside,0
kitchen was basic but clean as were the room toilets  common areas,1
great with a free safety box,0
i did not appreciate that you had to be out of the room between 1114 when cleaning was ongoing,1
close to the metro,0
very friendly staff,0
very misleading pictures basement setup with only 2 super small showers for the whole hostel,0
small community room with constant smell of weed,0
clean rooms and shower facilities friendly staff and the free breakfast was pretty good too,1
i was travelling alone and only staying 1 night,0
but i think the atmosphere would be better if you are in a group,0
location is great 5 mins walk from ox circus and tottenham ct rd stations,0
access to rooms was with key cards and lockable baskets were provided under beds,0
layout was a little confusing but not a major problem,0
5 min walk from swiss cottage tube no escalator at train station fantastic building awaits you and great social aspects,0
lockers in dorms are so tiny but extra locker space available including a safe,0
poor approach to welcome orientation by all staff,0
close to all amenities,0
situated on the rosenthaler platz this hostel has a perfect location,0
everything is easy reachable and the area is really good served,0
the hostel itself stands out with the incredible cleanliness,1
the breakfast has a good money value would recommend it,0
this hostel was incredible,0
my rooms were clean the bathrooms were clean and it was so conveniently located for touring and the nightlife,1
ill definitely be coming back here next time in london,0
overall a good hostel,0
clean rooms and great atmosphere,1
however no kitchen facilities,0
very hot hostel,0
no ac in the room,0
cannot sleep at night because of the heat,0
not coming back,0
on the positive there is one staff who is extremely helpful ,0
her name is tamara,0
cant say anything negative nice arrangement with bathroom next to doorms for females lovely interior and style relaxed but more than a backpackers place,0
definitely a good deal for the money you pay,0
could benefit from a common room area,0
very nice place,0
good atmosphere,0
decent place close to a lot of attractions and stations ,0
good crowd,0
but i thought the staff could do a bit more to get people interacting with each other ,0
clean hostel ,1
would stay there again,0
the beds were super uncomfortable,0
you can feel all the wires under neither,0
there was a severe lack of plugs for charging things,0
they had two charging holes per 4 beds so only two people could charge things and the other two couldnt,0
also the place was in a very old building,0
made it feel very dirty and unclean,1
the hostel is in a good location and the room was very clean,1
good value for money i will book aagain,0
the owner and staff ate very accomodating ,0
clean place too,1
david was really welcoming and a godsend after the trip we had just had,0
while we werent able to check in right away we got there early,0
we were able to shower and chill out in the patio,0
we were able to lock our important items up and leave our bags under watch while we went and got some food also recommended by david,0
he was lovely,0
really great service,0
the room was clean and accommodated our needs for one night,1
water pressure in the shower was wonderful,0
we would definitely stay again,0
great access to train stations both jr and other,0
nice small hostel with everything you need,0
bed are comfy showers are clean with hair dryers etc,1
good air con in rooms,0
it was good exactly what i wanted ,0
loved it,0
will come back before i leave japan,0
im sure,0
i had an excellent stay here,0
the staff were super friendly and helpful and the free drink every night was an amazing bonus,0
the beds were super comfortable and the pods in the dorm rooms were surprisingly very sound proof,0
the only minor inconvenience was the trek to the dorms on the 5th floor every day and the 45min distance from shibuya,0
otherwise a great place to stay,0
a very friendly and welcoming hostel ,0
small rooms and the staff made an effort to include all guests ,0
renovations and improvements are clearly being done and the kitchen area is great ,0
recommended ,0
a nice hostel,0
fun atmosphere in the bar area and the hostel stayers get a 25 discount,0
staff were very nice and helpful,0
no kitchen but the rest of the facilities were great,0
curtain on the bed was good and every bed has power outlets next to them,0
mostly clean everywhere,1
location was in a sort of dodgy area but very close to the train station which was helpful,0
awesome hostel in hongdae korea ,0
owner was so nice and welcoming and its really easy to make friends in this hostel,0
recommended if you like drinking and meeting new peopletravelers,0
had a great time here and will surely come back if i go back to korea,0
aloha hostel was very average,0
first of all you had to pay for your stay in cash only which was highly inconvenient,0
we were on the top floor and the rooms were very hot at night despite being next to an open window,0
thankfully we asked the staff for a fan and was able to get one,0
the showers were mouldy and cold water,0
the free breakfast was pretty good,0
but you had to be fast,0
otherwise the milk and juice would be warm,0
the hostel was located pretty much around the corner from historical tourist sights ,0
the staff were nice and the reception was always staffed however they didnt know about good places to go out to for night life when we asked ,0
there was no kitchen,0
so couldnt store food or make it ,0
the bathroom was clean ,1
the communal areas had no atmosphere and there werent many english guests when we went ,0
there was a luggage room to use once we had checked out and there were lockers in the room,0
good hostel in a very safeaccessible neighborhood,0
easy to travel to from the airportsmetrobus lines,0
really nice touches that they offer charging converters locks and other useful objects free of charge,0
staff is very friendly and helpful and the rooms are clean and offer large lockers ,1
great stay,0
this place was very nice,0
my only complaints are they often left the luggage door open and unmonitored when it was supposed to be locked,0
also the pillows were very lumpy and uncomfortable,0
despite this i would still recommend this hostel,0
i know the closed window gig is for security reasons but on a hot summer day with 7 other people it can get pretty disgusting,0
felt sick and could hardly breathe  get what you paid for i guess,0
i probably just had a bad experience,0
comfy beds but the sleep was dreadful due to the lack of air,0
you wake up and people would hog the single fan that couldnt even reach every person anyway and basically did nothing to cool the room down,0
also,0
?£25 to reserve a space,0
joke,0
this hostel is huge and bustling â?? feels larger than many hotels and the rooms had a hotellike feeling to me,0
the facilities were all very nice especially the rooms but due to the size i definitely felt that this hostel was much more impersonal than some of the smaller more friendly ones ive also stayed in,0
location is average â?? right beside a metro stop but not close to the seine and major paris attractions,0
average hostel with trendy downstairs bar,0
twin rooms are tiny and uninspiring felt a lot like prison cells with poor quality bedding,0
showers smelled like toilets poor quality plumbing,1
overall not an amazing hostel but this is somewhat offset by first impressions  the downstairs bar is very trendy but the overall stay doesnt live up to it,0
great location nice staff noisy evenings,0
great hostel near eiffel towergreat breakfastgreat facilities,0
like computers and,0
great welcoming,0
great room,0
we had a private room to sleep 2 2 single beds and the room was enormous,0
the windows opened right up and we had aircon aswell which is a big plus for hostels,0
still shocked by how big and spacious the room was,0
definitely would consider staying back here if ever in berlin again,0
the location is goodnear to many pubs and restaurants but the room and beds are too uncomfortable,0
the room was not airconditioned or ventilatedso there was too hot inside,0
the stuff was helpful and the breakfast was good but simple,0
clink 78 is a noisy and crowded hostel,0
i wouldnt recommend clink 78 hostel for your stay in london,0
two peas is located in the middle of china town great location and near a traincar line ,0
super convenient ,0
the staff were really helpful and nice ,0
the pods themselves were comfortable tho im fairly small 52 they felt big enough ,0
bathrooms were sort of far awaytwo floors from where i was staying ,0
kitchen had no ventilation so could be insanely hot during the day ,0
it was an overall good experience ,0
would book again,0
i was only one night in paris,0
it slipped by too quickly,0
the hostel was perfect,0
the staff were kind and helpful,0
i left quickly in the morning to catch my plane,0
the hostel was super clean,1
what you see is what you get,0
excellent faculties,0
the photographs on hostel world are acurate,0
would love to stay here again for a few more days,0
great hostel,0
the rooms were incredibly crowded and poorly up kept,0
the common areas were small and crowded as well,0
the hostel was right across a tube station but there wasnt much around very residently area way out of the city center,0
great rooms great views amazing facilities location is okay not that central but works as it is connected by public transport good atmosphere as the hostel is always happening,0
i absolutely loved staying here,0
great atmosphere and super friendly and helpful staff,0
close to transit so getting around from camden isnt a problem,0
id definitely stay here again would have extended my stay if it werent the end of my trip,0
this was the best hostel i have ever been to,0
super friendly staff great vibe and met a bunch of really nice people would recommend for sure,0
spacious by london standards modern ensuite facilities,0
plug and usb socket by each bed ???ì??Å¼???ì??Å¼late checkout ???ì??Å¼???ì??Å¼,0
my personal niggles  only ensuite rooms available with the nature of a hostel people come and go at various hours and this means even more noise and disruption,0
there were lengthy hairs in several places on the bed and in the basin and shower  no one staying in my room could have been responsible for these,1
out of the hostels control  but no air flow and no ac hot,0
we had a good stay at the red lantern hostel,0
wellorganised clean and cosy hostel with friendly staff,1
we asked if we could let send our train tickets ordered from a travel company to the hostel which was no problem and which they kept safely for us,0
breakfast can be ordered at additional cost but this is rather overpriced for what you get,0
all in all a very good stay at a good price,0
sadly because of circumstances i didnt end up staying the night here but the staff did help me to sort my issue by letting me use their laptop to contact friends etc,0
was a shame,0
i couldnt stay as the bar had a really good backpacker atmosphere and the rooms were clean and comfortable,1
the worst hostel i stayed in during my whole 2 month trip in china,0
very expencive and very not worthy of the 140 ,0
yuan per bed dorm room ,0
the room stincked of cigarettes the toilet was blocked and after 2 minutes shower the whole extremly tiny bathroom was flooded really flooded ,1
and if that is not bad enough we were asked to take the sheets out of the beds when we checked out ,0
dont go there ,0
stay was good a bit confusing at reception due to no check in or checking of passport or payment,0
based on trust which was unexpected but nice,0
great hostel and friendly environment,0
rooms are clean breakfast is good and the bar is the perfect place to meet people if youre travelling alone,1
had the best few days staying here,0
we stayed here for 2 nights in the very hot july weather,0
on entering the dorm via security card i could hardly breathe it was so hot and stuffy,0
it was impossible to get the window to stay open,0
i located an aircon switch on the wall and asked the man at reception about it,0
he came up and put it on and we were able to sleep despite the heat,0
the next night i came up late to the dorm and it was just the same,0
being very tired i didnt go back down to ask but regret this,0
it was terrible,0
great place to stay the food in bar was great and staff was friendly,0
the only thing is the security guard takes his job way too seriously and plays favorites when it comes to inforcing the quite rule in the smoking area,0
had to ask me if i actually stayed there when i wasnt saying anything and got blamed for being to loud ,0
but overall great place ,0
dont let that one thing deter you from staying there,0
unorganised but great location,0
the building is a bit weird because the hostel is just one floor and there are other business in the building,0
the location is very good,0
its in a nice neighborhood and super close to the ubahn,0
the bathrooms were nice,0
i had a private room which was spacious and clean,1
that view,0
what an amazing place,0
the location is just perfect really close to cool bars and hip restaurants,0
the staff is super helpful and lively,0
the free bbq on saturday was superb,0
it was a great place to meet all kinds of travellers enjoy the rooftop and then head out for some drinks and clubbin,0
would definitely come back,0
the wombats city hostel was very nice and had a good atmosphere,0
the rooms were clean and the ensuite was good,1
the staff were friendly and the hostel was located only a short walk from the centre also close to public transport routes,0
more than 30 mins to check in in other hostels it takes only 5mini had to fill out a form again with the same info even if i already had done my reservation online and pay by cash,0
cause they didnt have the terminal which i had to go find an atm ,0
not very good security theres only one key to the room and the last one to come out has to take it to the reception but people tend to forget and they dont give it back,0
the baggage room doesnt have lockers and anyone can have access to it,0
a little ways outside the city but right by a metro station so it was pretty easy to get around,0
the rooms were really nice and overall pretty clean,1
the rooftop bar is really cool with a great view and much better than the downstairs one,0
so i recommend checking that out,0
they are very organized here,0
the facilities were great even for 8 people to a room,0
there are plenty of public bathrooms around if you private one is busy,0
the location is perfect,0
i would come back again,0
the hostel just isnt very clean at all bathrooms were pretty disgusting ,1
outside of the rooms it was absolutely boiling in all the bathrooms and public areas,0
rooms had small ac units which at least cut through the stuffiness a bit ,0
i was on the top bunk and didnt feel safe at all,0
they are very rickety and old with no side rail ,0
the cafe bar and patio areas are all very nice places to chill but the hostel itself wasnt amazing,0
this was a great place,0
the only thing was at first it was very frustrating to find and the taxi drivers are not helpful,0
but after coming up from the asakusa station going right and walking to a main road then another right there until i came to a subway station entrance,0
i made a right there and the ks house is just about halfway down what looks like an alley,0
the sign is above and not lit so can be hard to see,0
but there is a family mart near there is a shrine near so much to see,0
very clean convenient location wonderful staff,1
this is a fun hostel and definitely a party hostel,0
its very easy to make friends here,0
the hosts are a lot of fun as well and make things fun,0
they double booked my room which was a bit of a nuisance cuz i had to walk to their other associated hostel a bit away in the scorching heat but outside of that,0
i had a blast here and would for sure stay here again,0
ac doesnt work very well fyi so plan for that cuz the rooms are very hot in summer,0
staff were on strike when arriving very frustrating trying to check in and get sorted,0
not much of an atmosphere even in the bar area where the drinks were extremely awful,0
rooms were spacious and bathrooms were cleaned daily,1
good kitchen and laundry facilities,0
only thing that really put this hostel down was no ac we were given a fan but the only plug we could put it in not over our heads in bed was broken so we roasted,0
stayed in better wombats,0
the rooms were adorable  super clean,1
the common area downstairs by the entrance is a great place to hangout with new friends too,0
good location however it was so hot some nights it was impossible to sleep,0
was not as easy to meet people as in other hostels,0
showers and bathrooms were tiny and pretty grimy,1
overall ok stay,0
had a great stay at london backpackers,0
the staff is amazing and the vibe is awesome,0
there was no hot water at the time of our stay and this seems to have been an issue for a long time,0
otherwise helpful friendly staff some confusion over our check in but all sorted by a quick call  security of rooms relies on very old often broken lockers and other people in the room remembering to lock the door with the key,0
overall good,0
rooms were a bit tight on space but other than that i really enjoyed my stay,0
plus the pubcrawl was amazing,0
i had so much fun  made some really awesome friends,0
loved it ,0
extended my stay and dont see a reason to go any other place,0
nice and clean able to use guest shower before check in,1
a lovely hostel our flight was delayed and they were very helpful in allowing us to check in late,0
the hostel has a nice laidback vibe and the staff are friendly and informative ,0
stayed in the female dorm which was comfortable and quiet,0
highly recommend this hostel and would use again,0
had a really pleasant stay here and would recommend it to people if they didnt want to stay in the up and coming areas of berlin,0
kitchen facilities are not convenient for most rooms the place is huge but we ate out around berlin anyway,0
so it wasnt an issue,0
overwhelmingly positive experience,0
very clean well organised hostel with a great atmosphere ,1
pros ,0
 right next to kuramae station shinjuku without transfers and close to asakusa st,0
shibuya without transfers ,0
 very cool and clean  really welcoming and professional staff  easy going people youthful atmosphere ,0
 great caf?? full of locals  proper barista level coffee ,0
cons  if youre like me and grab 2 coffees a dayit adds up ,0
thanks kaede for practising japanese with me,0
probably one of the worst hostels iv stayed in,0
there was lockers in the room to lock your things away but none of them worked there was absolutely no source of air conditioning in our 10 person room so was extremely hot and smelly,0
they offered no source of kitchen or fridge for you to store anything as we needed food for our bus ride on last day the staff at reception were rude and never smiled or polite ,0
the showers were grubby and needed the biggest scrub and clean,1
the rooms in the basement had now windows so it gets extremely hot and stuffy ,0
also the bathrooms were constantly closed for cleaning and you had to pay ?£8 if you want brekkie there which wasnt that great,0
while the location of the hostel was conveniently close to the north train station it did not have basic amenities,0
there was no shower curtain and the shower was in view of many neighbors the laundry service was down so we were unable to rent towels and the hostel was unbelievably hot during the entire stay,0
the bathroom showed obvious signs of a lack of proper cleaning for example we found bugs in the bathtub and lots of hair on the floor,1
i had a great stay,0
one of the best hostels ive ever stayed in,0
nice facilities,0
subway and groceries around the corner,0
hostel is a bar as well,0
unfortunately the bar closes at 2am and if you have to wake up early your kinda sol,0
bar is mostly french as well,0
i really enjoyed my stay at palmers lodge,0
everyone was nice and i was very comfortable with the facility,0
i stayed in all female 4 bedroom and left with a new friend,0
awesome place overall,0
felt very comfortable and at home straight away,0
highly recommend this place,0
dont forget to ask about rosss pub crawl one of the highlights of our stay,0
highly recommend this hostel,0
very modern barclub is good,0
downside would be the lack of kitchen and you arent allowed to bring your own food in so not ideal for anyone on a budget,0
quite far from the centre however theres two metro stops very close,0
i only stayed one night but had a very positive experience,0
staff were very friendly and helpful when storing my bag after i checked out the rooms and facilities were really nice and clean and surprisingly spacious,0
i would definitely stay again and recommend it to anyone ,0
great place very good location lot of nice cafes in the neighborhood,0
it was a great hostel we had a family room as we had our 3 5 yr olds with us,0
we were lucky to have the top room with a roof terrace so the boys had a private space out of the room,0
the grounds are beautiful and the local park was great ,0
we did however have to called reception at 2340 as the lower rooms were really loud  stamping around,0
the staff responded neutrally  swiftly ,0
we did also unfortunately have neighbouring guests who liked to just let their  the shared bathroom door,0
nice clean hostel in a good location,1
great spot,0
lots of fun uk boyz,0
the door was open all the time so actually anyone could get in ,0
the beds were not assigned so that we just got into the room and took one that looked ass if it was free but it wasnt so it was pretty annoying for the girl who slept there the night before to get there and realize that someone else was sleeping on her bed ,0
the wifi didnt work there were only a few wall plugs next to the door of the room so we had to leave our phones there ,0
the breakfast was great,0
horrible experience here,0
was in an all girls 14 person dorm arrived late at night to find girl above me brought a guy in the room and continued to sleep with him on top of me,0
complained to staff as they wouldnt stop and staff said they would do nothing about it,0
left the next morning,0
bathrooms are gross,1
also if you are sleeping anywhere near a window good luck trying to sleep,0
i didnt know what to expect bc,0
i had never stayed in a hostel,0
it was fabulous,0
amazing if youre solo traveller,0
great atmosphere,0
i have had limited experience staying in hostels and did not know what to expect,0
the room i stayed in was extremely cramped and was far too small to sleep 6 people even 4 would be a stretch,0
the room got so hot at night even with the window open and the fan open,0
the window is tiny and there is no air flow everything stinks in regards to the rooms at this place,0
i have since stayed at a cheaper hostel with a room 4x,0
it was ideal,0
id recommend it for that but not as a place to meet travel buddies,0

thoroughly enjoyed my stay at hostel one,0
the staff and volunteers were welcoming friendly and super fun to hangout with  they made our trip that much more fun,0
the free dinner was delicious and a great way to meet everyone staying,0
the structure of happy hour  drinking games  going out is a great way of doing things and made everyone staying at the hostel feel like a friend,0
definitely recommend,0
good ,0
only problem with sharing shower and 2 wc with male guest,0
room has mosquitos and trash bin walls dirty ,1
a little mo cleaning will improve,1
would have been nice to have a safe available for our passports,0
we got a room with a double bed which was kinda uncomfortable and the room is small,0
great location but would have preferred a comfier stay for what we paid for,0
when we were there it was extremely hot in london and very stuffy throughout the hostel,0
it was a good place to stay quite cosy,0
friendly staff,0
breakfast was free but mostly breads and cheeses the coffee was burnt,0
beautiful historic building and the location was excellent,0
really just a place to sleep though the outdoor courtyard was lovely,0
my friend and i were in a 4 bed female dorm but there was one set of bunk beds and the other was a bed with another pull out one in the middle of the floor,0
it meant absolutely no walking space and was certainly not advertised as a bed on the floor it was advertised as bunk beds,0
overall was nice and the rooms were nice,0
although the shower head was too low in some showers im 510 and i was a full head above the shower head so made it very difficult to shower,0
also the elevator was out of service so had to carry my 20kg backpack and other backpack up 6 flights of stairs,0
was very inconvenient and it was like that all week staff didnt talk about it whatsoever or apologiseoffer anything for the inconvenience,0
good little place to stay if you just want somewhere to rest your head,0
nice rooms nice staff nice location just no social vibe there but no complaints,0
staff people are very helpful but egypt is not easy to move around,0
hotels and hostels are very old and in very bad conditions,1
egypt was a superb culture in the past,0
not anymore,0
saar from israel ,0
before my flight i stayed in the hostel for a few nights i really liked the atmosphere super friendly staff that willing to help every time,0
the hostel really clean which hard to find in india ,1
located a bit far from the center but one can reach the metro station easily by tuktuk or walking ,0
highly recommend ,0
pro  great location not in a too touristy area lovely pub called the queens head very close by,0
the building is cool old town hall clean safe con  unable to sleep due to lack of air circulation they cant change the building,1
so it is outdated absolutely no oxygen small room no window staff could be friendlier and say something about what hostel offers too big families and big tourist groups it seems like a nice hostel but dont stay here,0
 you wont be able to sleep at all,0
amazing host and amazing people,0
would definitely come back here for a good time,0
loved this place was soo much better than all the other hostels ive been in,0
met some really fun people,0
location is great because its a walk from berlin wall and the s bahn and u bahn train,0
if your flying in read their directions on how to get there and its a lifesaver,0
had a fantastic time in the hostel and will definitely be coming back again,0
staff were always so helpful,0
great location an okish hostel,0
they play loud music into the night which you can fully hear,0
the key cards wouldnt work with the elevators so you had to go up floors with your luggage then use a floor that had buttons instead of the key card insert,0
the room was extremely tiny there was nothing separating the shower from the rest of the restroom so the water went everywhere,0
the cabinets underneath the bunks got stuck and the outlets didnt work,0
the place is very well located and easy to move around many interesting places in tokyo,0
staff friendly and willing to help all the time,0
great hostel with great staff clean rooms and nice showers in each of the rooms,1
this is just not a very young and social hostel so dont expect to meet any travellers around 1835yo,0
maybe it was just the time we came but it was mainly kids with their parents hanging around in the common area,0
overall very good only downside rooms were a bit hot,0
great atmosphere in the common areas,0
staff were friendly and helpful,0
rooms were modern and clean,1
plenty of bathrooms and showers,0
there is a barrestaurant but we would have liked to have a kitchen,0
short walk to train station,0
maybe enforce a lights off policy after 11pm,0
we had other guests coming in to the room at 1am turning the light on when we had to catch an early train,0
apart from that we loved this hostel and would come back again,0
a friend and i booked 2 bunk beds on short notice the night before when we got stranded in tokyo with nowhere to stay ,0
i was worried that oji would be out of the way but with public transportation was a convenient ride away ,0
i forgot some bags in my room and the amazing staff kept it safe for me until i returned to tokyo a week later,0
thank you so much,0
as there is no air conditioning in this hostel and during mid july its was super hot and stuffy inside the room,0
i cant really sleep with it,0
there is no air ventilation in the room,0
in a great location close to city centre was very clean friendly staff great atmosphere cheap drinks,1
have to pay for towels and linen however these are only around 2 euros each so not a problem,0
really enjoyed our stay here would highly recommend,0
would totally recommend it,0
great location cool building and rooms even though theres not much space left on it besides the bunk beds and lockers,0
 its clean and nice ,1
worst things,0
the wifi doesnt work that good you have to connect to it every time you come back to the hostel,0
top bunk bed is really high and the first step is kind of too far away from the floor if youre not a tall person,0
maybe add another step ,0
best things showers are greatroom and pressure,0
cash machine,0
good location,0
close to many transit stops,0
staff is very nice and accommodating,0
bar upstairs is really fun and has a cheap breakfast,0
they printed things out for us for free which was nice,0
lots of great restaurants nearby,0
the one complaint we have is that the wifi doesnt work in your rooms so you have to go upstairs or to the lobby,0
we were also there in very hot weather and there was no air con just a small fan that didnt reach anybody,0
this hostel is really central and easy to locate,0
in general the staff were helpful with food recommendations etc,0
nice washrooms,0
unfortunately there was a pretty serious bed bug incident while we were present that affected multiple beds in the female dorm,1
the manager dealt with it fairly well and was apologetic however i feel like there should have been greater urgency to resolve situation and staff should check beds more often,1
good little hostel we only stayed one night,0
but it was very clean and got a good sleep,1
good spot good location not too far away from tokyo eki,0
easy access to other train lines in tokyo,0
it was quiet clean and secure,1
nice hostel for a good price you either bring your own bed sheets and towels or pay for renting them at the reception,0
taxes are all included in the price,0
food is nice,0
check out is a bit early10 am,0
5 mins away from 2 sbahn stations,0
thanks for the good stay,0
my stay at st christophers wasnt really anything special,0
however the location is good and staff are lovely,0
the bathroom floors are always yet from the adjoining showers,0
someone threw up in my room and it took two of us going to the front desk two separate times to finally get it cleaned,1
super close to train station and subway stops which is nice too,0
its a huge hostel with a lot of big groups so not sure i wouldve met anyone if not for my lovely roommates,0
very helpful staff who gave us recommendations and directions,0
had a quiet laid back atmosphere,0
only downside was a strange odor coming from the bathroom at all times and the free breakfast was a bit too light,1
a nice hostel thats cheap and with a convenient location near a subway station,0
the pillow and blankets are super comfortable i slept really well,0
they also upgraded us from a 6person dorm to a 4person for free,0
it seems pretty sound proof as i didnt hear any of the guests in the other rooms ,0
id definitely stay here again,0
the hostel is in a beautiful location and the staff was helpful,0
i didnt stay for breakfast because i had to leave early in the morning to catch a train so cant comment on that,0
would have liked security lockers and there was no wifi in the rooms,0
we were in a 5 room door and had it to ourselves which was nice,0
however there wasnt a fan or air con,0
so i found it very hard to sleep,0
the location also isnt very good you definitely need a metro pass,0
private rooms very small and hot noisy street outside,0
few toilets and showers and not very nice,1
good location supermarkets very close and a good connection to the city centre,0
overally ok if you are very tired and jest need some place to sleep,0
but not to recommend if you want to enjoy your stay ,0
great location and had a nice courtyard to hang out in however there was so air con in rooms,0
and it was unbelievably hot,0
pretty easy to get here ,0
the staff i interacted with were nice and helpful ,0
the room was slightly closterphobic for me with one window very high ,0
i did spot ants on my table with the coffee machine,1
so i made sure to keep all my stuff zipped ,0
next to a very noisy street,0
but i became prepared with a white noise machine ear plugs and an eye mask ,0
pretty decent shower for a hostel too,0
awesome ,0
i have never seen any hostel like this before ,0
hindustan heaven hostel has everything to give you ,0
they treat you like their own family members ,0
whatever i asked them  they had provided me ,0
from now on  whenever i go to delhi  i will book hindustan heaven hostel  fabulous,0
â¤,0
ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸,0
this hostel was in a great location,0
it was within walking distance to a ton of sites and the metro and bus stations,0
there are great restaurants and a grocery store nearby too,0
the common areas and breakfast made it easy to meet other people,0
the only thing to be aware of is that the security lockers are very small but you can at least leave your passport in it,0
it can also be loud at night but if you close the window that helps a lot with the noise,0
good bits nice staff good location short walk to tube station cheap rooms clean room ok bed ,1
bad bits cash only,0
in 2018 ,0
loud crappy music til 3am expensive drinks lecherous men in bar,0
bouncers turn a blind eye ,0
tiny lockers no place to store big bags ,0
noisy beds mice in the kitchen with droppings on the floor one shared toilet between a whole floor of people ,1
its a little away from the city centre,0
staff are friendly and has a nice common area,0
felt kinda gross in the bathrooms but everything else was great,1
bed was actually pretty comfy,0
breakfast was okay and worth it if you need to but try to find something else first,0
had the best time at comebackpackers,0
great atmosphere great common room space,0
staff were really friendly and helpful,0
couldnt recommend it any higher,0
there is no air conditioning and some of the other facilities like the shower pressure could be improved but overall it is really great,0
cheers,0
this hostel is in the best location,0
it is the perfect base for exploring london,0
my only issue with it was that there are no lockers in the room,0
the Â£2 breakfast is pretty good  you can have toast cheese jams yoghurt fruit four kinds of cereal and tea coffee and juice,0
great area and facility,0
very close to london  tower bridge and the borough market,0
close to public transportation restaurantsbars and shopping,0
staff was awesome too,0
this hostel is probably one of the favorites ive stayed at,0
the location is great the staff were awesome they have a great breakfast and the common area is the coolest,0
the atmosphere of staying in a relaxed hostel that used to be a wing of a still active church was a really unique experience,0
we stayed in a private ensuite and it was sparkling clean,1
we would come back for sure,0
loction is great ,0
need to ad ac or at list a fan in the rooms,0
expecting a traditional hostel i was pleasantly surprised to show up and see that its a hotel,0
great value for the price close to the subway and in a good area,0
we would definitely stay here again,0
it is located very conveniently next to a metro station but not too close to the centre which is ok because of the transport link,0
the bedrooms were spotless and it was really great having a usb port in the bed etc,0
and a light,0
the bathrooms and showers could have been cleaner,1
the who experience was interesting because it was like a huge swanky hotel but you shared a room and bathrooms with people the place was massive,0
at night it was very hard to sleep with the noise outside on the street,0
i only had a quick night here but the staff were very friendly the facilities and beds great even a small gym downstairs and even though its not the best part of paris i had a train the next morning which left from right up the street,0
overall solid stay,0
i had a great experience here at time travelers relax,0
dj and robert were so nice and even when my flight got cancelled they let me stay an extra night,0
theyre also very funny,0
dj makes amazing food for lunch on tuesdays and also offers breakfast in the mornings hes there,0
the room is spacious and a nice quiet place especially after a long day of being out,0
the location is convenient just a minutes walk to the heart of hongdae,0
met some interesting people,0
i had a lot of fun,0
everything is good expect the speed of internet,0
good hostel especially the deluxe room and the area is superb,0
this hostel was exactly what we wanted,0
the rooms were very clean staff was very helpful and the barrestaurant made the environment so much better,1
the hostel tours are also very convenient and great,0
met so many great people here and had some really good times highly recommend this place,0
very very big hostel with a good bar with good food on the ground floor,0
 location is great if your using gare du nord but need to be careful outside the hostel ,0
its clean lots of good beds secure big lockers in each room,1
only for one night,0
but staff was fantastic and made my short stay fantastic,0
i was a bit surprised that in order to store your luggage you need to pay for a locker and have coins,0
you also have to carry your bag downstairs,0
the staff did not prewarn me about this before going to the storage room,0
however a staff member also ended up helping me with this as i didnt have enough coins,0
if you are short haha then it can be a disadvantage as well,0
i was also surprised that my private room did not have an ensuite,0
however overal this was still a good place to stay,0
good security and staff,0
rooms were a good size and very clean,0
i enjoyed my stay at hostel toronto,0
easily accessible by the public transport,0
staff were very friendly and very helpful,0
only downside was the room i was in had no lockers  not even little ones to put valuables in,0
luckily nothing happened but having the option would be nice,0
love this place third time here,0
great atmosphere and staff,0
a 1Â£ breakfast comfy beds,0
the receptionists are always great,0
the bathrooms arent great and theres only powerpoints on the floor but the excitement and enthusiasm they bring more than makes up for it,0
 great beer pong too,0
a very clean and compact hostel with no spreading out but still with the freedom to enjoy berlins night life ,1
i didnt stay long enough to judge whether you could sleep all day without too much disruption ,0
you must wait in the tv room to book in not because you are bad but because the reception is tiny and the tourist tax a pain to calculate ,0
the large garden compensates for inside and the kitchen caters to individual needs ,0
report hassle to reception immediately ,0
first hostel i ever stayed at and after going to more on my trip through europe i can say this hostel is not for me,0
it is really clean big plenty of space location is average,1
was close to train station though,0
it is just too big for there to be a community vibe to it,0
if you want peace and quiet stay here,0
if you want to remember your travels by the people you meet this isnt the place,0
out of the five hostels i stayed in while in japan this was my favorite,0
best atmosphere with the bar up front staffed by awesome bartenders creating an easy to use space for people to hang out at night,0
the facilities were a little outdated bedrooms specifically but clean and secure,1
would highly recommend,0
pretty good hostel with the bare necessities that i needed ie bed hot water,0
staff is very friendly and welcoming,0
they hold your luggage for free which i appreciated,0
be prepared to walk if you are on the top floor soooo many stairs,0
overall i am very happy with my decision to stay here,0
cheers,0
very kind welcoming reception,0
we were early for check in because of our flight times,0
and they let us in without extra charge,0
superb spacious hostel in great location central ,0
the staff at the hostel were lovely,0
food and coffees were nice and reasonably priced,0
the downstairs social area was really nice,0
only downfall was that the communal bathrooms were not very nice,1
hostel asks Â£5 for storage room on your check out which is a hidden fee and uncommon for any accommodation,0
showers and bathrooms are not cleaned often and toilets and drains were blocked and filthy with hair and papers lots of flies in the rooms,1
staff was not welcoming to let you in till 1400 although rooms were empty,0
lockers are very narrow in the rooms and not the gold standard nowadays spacious under the bed that you can easily put in your belongings,0
sixbed room with two bathrooms hard to beat ,0
but no cooking facilities,0
cant make noodles with a microwave,0
very nice place to stay ,0
walking distance to the centre located in a hutong lovely neighbourhood ,0
the hostel books events and tours to the main attractions and visiting places outside the city ,0
nice place to stay,0
recommend it,0
good location really overpriced,0
not really social not many spots to hangout with people,0
other wombats around europe were better,0
only problem communal showers,0
if anyone else is having a shower at the same time you will see each other naked,0
also 3 lockers for each bed was a little much especially since it took up space under the bed so bags ended up everywhere in the way ,0
other than that location was fantastic beds comfy,0
loved the shelves by the beds for belongings light  power outlets,0
lovely hostel such nice staff who spoke good english helped us with lids of stuff as wed never been to berlin before,0
really clean huge room big windows light and airy big bathrooms,1
short walk from the metro but location is kind of in the middle of nowhere,0
to briefly sum up my time here in berlin i extended my stay 5 nightsincredible experience and staff,0
thank you ,0
well be back,0
the showers were kind of gross and there was nowhere to put your stuff because it was wet everywhere,1
theres no lockers in the rooms and you all share one key so if one person is in the room the room will be unlocked,0
the patio is nice but expect to be woken up by the clanking of the furniture at around 7 if you have a window facing it,0
free breakfast was great,0
ett mycket enkelt hotel valskott och rent,0
laget ar bra och omrÃ¥det tyst ,0
jag motte genomgÃ¥ende en mycket service minded uppmÃ¤rksam och hjÃ¤lpsam personal allt frÃ¥n reception servering och stÃ¤dning ,0
en utmÃ¤rkt frukost i relation till priset ,0
for den som reser mycket och inte vill lagga pengarna pa Ã¶vernattning ar detta en mycket bra hotell som jag kan rekommendera ,0
the staff were incredibly helpful the location was great very close to a variety of shops and restaurants and train station,0
only negative comment would be on lack of security no safes for small valuables no keys for doors etc,0
had no problems at all though,0
overall a great place,0
we were lucky to have double entry into our room meaning we had to go through one room to get to ours adding to the security grade,0
close location to bars supermarkets metro and catacombs,0
staff was least talkative ive been around but noting negative,0
breakfast offered is traditional french breakfast bread and jam so dont expect much if you have an american or english appetite,0
coffee machine is free in the morning,0
and its great,0
pretty happy with this hostel the staff were lovely and helpful the communal kitchen was massive and well equipped ,0
it does seem to have a couple of minor maintenance issues both our dorms ensuite bathroom locks were broken bathroom door and the toilet door and the cleaning couldve been a bit more thorough ,1
but lots of cheap eats nearby risa chicken is amazing drunken food and very easy to get around with excellent access to the metro,0
clean room and bathroom modern design and nice lobby free towel hair dryer at bathroom everything is perfect except just that the rules are quite strict here,1
no food or drinks allowed to bring into hostel from outside a security guy check your bags and your key card every time you go into the hostel and checkout time 930am,0
great,0
it was charming cute and in the perfect location for nightlife thrifting and record shops,0
food is incredible,0
if you are interested in going to berghain and the coolest part of town stay here,0
everything was clean and free coffee available in reception,1
my only complaint was i received a notice on my bed one morning saying i had a 5euro charge because i made my bed wrong  i wasnt charged but their way of cleaning the linens seemed concerning,0
 i just slept without for,0
it was hot,0
accommodations are small but par for the neighborhood considering the size of paris buildings,0
breakfast is just what you need before a day of sightseeing and every room is cleaned regularly,1
staff is helpful to those who need directions or shuttle services,0
great experience great people,0
everything i hoped it would be,0
there is no security of your belongings one person theft my iphone and money,0
and the staff didnt help you,0
not recommended to guests,0
hostel is situated close to kings cross which makes it very convenient to reachstaff were very cooperative and helped us out big time on multiple occassions,0
some rooms are quite small others are okay,0
so you need to get lucky to get a decent sized room,0
kitchen is quite big and well equipped,0
breakfast is also damn cheap and good for the what they charge,0
this hostel is clearly the best hostel that ive seen in london  ,0
the staff is a bunch of young people who are fun and caring probably even too much ,0
everythings brand new the guests have to be respectful and clean after themselves to keep this place amazingly clean and pleasant ,1
spacious common areas,0
kitchen,0
fridges to save your food,0
247 assistance  ,0
close to notting hill station hyde park,0
 buses ,0
shops  ,0
thanks guys,0
xxx,0
as expected from other reviews anne hostel was a great place to stay,0
the thing that struck me was the location just enough out of the city to ease into the madness that is tokyo on your first night the second quality was the knowing me when i checked in,0
the lounge  kitchen was a really cool quiet place to relax bar the odd american,0
the only thing let down was a noisy room people unpacking at 1am or leaving at 4am this needs to be enforced more  i did not sleep well due to noise,0
best facilities of any hostel i stayed at in japan,0
comfortable bed and very private large capsule,0
storage inside your capsule and beneath it,0
need to rent lock,0
if you are looking for a place to meet people and socialize with travelers from other countries this is the place,0
if you are trying to get some work done while you travel this might not be the best fit,0
next to a supermarket if you want to save mondy and cook for yourself,0
oh and complementary alcoholic beverage every night,0
i spent 7 nights here and the location is unbelievable,0
extremely friendly staff and thoroughly enjoyed my time here being my first hostel experience,0
a great hostel,0
am returning to stay again before i head home,0
good vibes and a sociable hostel so worth the money ,0
the rooms themselves are not very nice but if youre planning to be outside all the time that shouldnt be an issue,0
best hostel in all india ,0
firstly a very clean hostel,1
absolutely great atmosphere with a comfy common area including music booksgames smart tv computers fast wifi and a rooftop garden,0
each room equiped with fans aircon during the night large lockers and bathroom for each room ,0
free delicious breaky every morning as well as refillable ro water ,0
i would def recommend to anyone and travel here again ,0
thank you,0
anas shrey  all the great people at the mad packers,0
room is nice and clean the view of the rooftop bar are great good cafe and lounge area staff but cold but cos they are busy need to pay for the lockers and sometime is full,1
the location was great close to victoria and walking distance to a tube shops etc,0
the room i stayed in was a 4 person room but was super tiny they shouldnt have more than two people in a room that small ,0
luckily enough i was the only one there so it was fine,0
they had two fans to beat the heat which was great,0
the bathrooms were dirty and smelly and really brought the whole experience down,1
reception staff were friendly and the wifi worked fine,0
good enough for a one night stay in london,0
the emblem hostel ticks all the boxes you look for in a hostel being security cleanliness staff atmosphere accessible to a supermarket n cheap food options so no complaints in that aspect ,1
i read alot of reviews saying poor location etc etc however with tokyos train system the location of the emblem hostel comes down to the type of traveller you are ,0
the emblem isnt the place to stumble back to at 0300 however the emblem is a solid base for day trips to soak in tokyo,0
this was one of the worst hostels ive stayed at,0
very unhygienic the toilets always clogged and you always had to use to plunger to unclog the toilet,1
stains on the bed and pillows uncomfortable bed springs hanging out of the bed paint pealing of the walls,1
reception spoke very little english they dont organise tours and were not helpful with information to and from the area,0
beds not numbered so you would pick a bed and then someone could come in and move your stuff and have that bed,0
we stayed in the female only dorm and it was really nice,0
good staff good location good value,0
the one draw back would have been no air conditioning but fans were provided to help fight the heat,0
awesome hostel,0
perfect area in the middle of the performer street of hongdae,0
close to food bars and entertainement,0
sabrina is the best hostel manager ive had so far of many hostels in korea,0
great hostel nice clean private curtain on beds dorms,1
close to a few of the main metro lines,0
this hostel is very good at low price,0
i well received wifi and it was powerful in my bedroom 22 bed dormitory,0
the atmosphere in the kitchen is very good to meet new people,0
at bar you have a pool 1 pound 2 free chess game and you can put your laptop or smartphone,0
anywhere you want plug included,0
this hostel is also very well situated manor house station is in zone 2 and 3 10 minutes by bus or 15 minutes on foot so you can visit all london at a bargain price with your oyster card,0
comebackpackers is located next to u kotbusser tor so very easy to travel more central,0
tourist spots are still in walking distance 40 mins if you prefer,0
kitchen was great and common room was big meaning it was easy to meet people,0
not so much of a community feel though,0
you couldnt bring in your own drinks though which was a bummer  a beer cost 2â‚¬,0
it was not as advertised,0
there were many more beds in the room than i was told ,0
so i left after one night,0
fine place clean roomsbathrooms no kitchen loud bar,1
the hostel has a lot of potential,0
it hs an amazing staff with great hospitality,0
one individual that made this experience wonderful was johan machado,0
he went above and beyond to make sure we felt welcomed,0
one thing that needs improvement asap is the ac,0
we couldnt sleep at night because it was so hot,0
its a must,0
lovely hostel and great value for money,0
everything was clean and the beds were super comfortable,1
i would definitely stay here again,0
one of a kind hostel,0
definetely worth staying,0
probably not the most modern one but very cozy,0
nice hostel right next to the subway station,0
they let me stay in the tv room after check out which was nice,0
staff is friendly and helpful,0
i have stayed in many hostels but hands down whitetail has been my favorite,0
i stayed in the all female dorm and the room was really nice,0
bonus points for having actual mattresses that werent uncomfortable,0
the staff was fantastic they were so warm and welcoming,0
especially nicky,0
if i ever come back to seoul and need a place to stay i would for sure stay again at whitetail,0
hostel was really dirty and there was mould on the windows also they didnt seem to wash the duvets at all as they had no covers and smelled really bad,1
also the cleaners moved all of our stuff around but didnt actually seem to clean anything,1
even without the state of the rooms the hostel felt unfriendly and had weird rules to do with the keys,0
also the wifi didnt work,0
worst place we stayed in the entire trip ,0
however breakfast was nice and the metro station is close by,0
we have to climb three floors with heavy luggageno lift ,0
kitchen quite dirty many flies inadequate cooking facilities,1
great hostel super close to the metro and very clean,1
be careful however when it is warm outside since there are no fans in the rooms and the windows cannot open fully the room will get very very warm,0
other than that the room itself 4 beds was amazing and clean and the free breakfast in the morning is a nice plus,0
great location friendly and knowledgeable staff nice kitchen comfortable beds clean rooms cool terrace area,1
allaround great vibe,0
great hostel not far from public transport to the main city and even close enough to walk if youre a trekker,0
staff was very accommodating and sincere great place to meet people from all over as well,0
the staff was helpful and the room was clean ,1
the fan in the ensuite turned on for 510 minutes every time the door was opened and it was very loud and squeaky,0
the beds dont have builtin charger ports so devices needed to be charged exposed from a wall outlet ,0
but overall very smooth and pleasant experience,0
 i found myself with a minor emergency and took the overnight bus back to london within twenty four hours ,0
management at pegasus were sweet about the cancellation when they didnt have to be ,0
i look forward to visiting when i return to berlin ,0
clubbers have surpassed travellers in berlin and the lack of tolerance and understanding in some reeks ,0
pegasus showed heart ,0
the main negative is its a large hostel with only 2 washing machines and 2 dryers,0
the bathrooms are also stuffy and not always very clean,1
but as a place just to sleep before exploring paris it is literally across the street from a metro stop,0
good location,0
staff very friendly,0
hostel is dirty at least for my standard,1
common area is gross dark and smelly,1
lets say that it does not encourage you to use it and therefore socialise with others,0
if you are taller than mewhich is not hard seen that i am only 53 ft avoid getting the 12 bed doom,0
the bed space was so tiny i couldnt sit down on the bed to get dress etc,0
breakfast is alright,0
you get what you get for paying Â£3,0
overal was ok seen the location the staff and the price,0
great location if you are looking to explore berlins nightlife and diverse drinkingeating spaces ,0
the dorms are okay with shared bathroom facilities that can not be faulted,0
we had towels on our bed which was an added bonus and clean beds to sleep on ,1
staff can be quite uninterested in enquiries but information on city tours and hostel events are easily sign posted in lobby,0
restaurant is decent and theres a nice terrace you can take drinks to ,0
look out for the alternative walking tour,0
stayed in the generator paris  loved it so didnt hesitate with this hostel,0
i booked a single ensuite so wasnt expecting to be the only person in a dorm room,0
annoyingly although my bed was made up there were dirty sheets in there when i arrived,1
there was also rubbish underneath the bed ,1
i wouldnt have minded the no outside food policy if the bottles of soda werent â‚¬250 ,0
kinda sad about it because i probably wouldnt stay there again although its great location,0
i really felt unsafe in the area,0
its an ok hostel but isnt central,0
rooms are super super small,0
the general common areas are good and clean,1
we were in the basement which was a little disappointing but i suppose someone has to be in that room,0
the room was on the small side with no room to place and open our 2 large suitcases,0
cleanliness was ok not exceptional,1
however the location was top notch and the price was good value,0
the bed was reasonably comfortable but the mattress will need replacing soon,0
one recommendation would be that the place needs some money spent on it to brighten up the decor,0
it is looking very tired ,0
decent hostel cheap and good atmosphere,0
its far from the city centre but theres a metro stop close by,0
it feels a like a factory due to the massive size and number of rooms,0
the security is lacking theres a cage you can lock under the beds,0
but they can be easily accessed even when locked,0
showers werent working on our floor and we werent shown any others which was very irritating,0
ended up using the disabled ones,0
a pleasant surprise,0
very clean and comfortable no air con but there are big windows,1
even the shared bathrooms were very okay,0
not in the center but walking distance from checkpoint charlie and there is a sbahn station nearby within three stops you can go to potsdamer platz brandenburg tor nd friedrichstrasse,0
quiet at night,0
there is a supermarket next to the hostel,0
staff was nice and the laundry service is pretty cheap,0
would definitely recommend,0
the only complaint with this property was the location it is a little ways from central parts of tokyo,0
but it is completely worth it,0
there were several restaurants and markets walking distance,0
the lobby and outside terrace was a great place to meet other travelers,0
awesome little place right by all the sights of asakusa,0
easy to get to and to get to other areas from for sightseeing,0
excellent staff and the premises were always well looked after,0
couldnt ask for better,0
great location great for young people as there was a bar and music down stairs,0
great vibe,0
dont forget to take a lock as there is storage in the rooms you just need to bring a lock,0
great value for money and location is in central downtown so makes it easy to get around in cairo,0
staffs are all very friendly and willing to help out on your itinerary not just in cairo but all of egypt,0
meet some great people along the way so go for it,0
everything is great,0
need to improve beds they are noisy and not to comfortable other than that perfect,0
quiet and chilled out hostel,0
good aircon,0
it was so humid when my boyfriend and i stayed,0
loved the privacy curtains around each bed  really made a difference after a long haul flight ,0
bathroom and kitchen were spotless ,1
this hostel has a fab location and staff were really friendly,0
only problem is the extra money you have to pay for everything locks towels etc and the lack of a kitchen,0
apart from that everything was brill,0
staff are really helpful and friendly,0
very chill environment,0
i stayed there for two nights,0
hostel staff was so nice ,0
hostel was very clean and walking distance from subway,1
rooms are small but nice,0
i enjoyed my stay there,0
great atmosphere and amazing staff,0
they couldnt do enough to help us,0
raghu was so friendly and a good addition to the madpackers team,0
the delhi belly tour was a great way to explore old delhi and meet other travellers,0
the hostel was amazing and honestly i want to go back for a weekend,0
great facilities lovely staff and plenty of activities they host,0
i was in the female dorm,0
no air condition and we only has one window ,0
it was super hot,0
i complained of bud bugs and the front counter person told me its impossible,1
i was like why would i lieafter much hesitation he got the manager of the cleaning department who changed my bedding,1
i did experience any bed bags after that,1
breakfast was ok,0
most of the staff was good except one staff member as above,0
the room itself is fine and the bathroom is big and clean,1
the price is also quite good for london,0
the main issue is the location  it is kind of far from the centre of london and it is on a main road so is very noisy even in the middle of the night,0
staff were friendly,0
there was not much of a social atmosphere so not good for solo travellers,0
the title of the hostel says it pretty well,0
 its a party hostel many very outgoing people literally every day till 6am are staying and getting in contact is no problem at all ,0
staff was nice and helpful ,0
the rooms are all somewhat connected so even staying in the 4bed dorm can be quite noisy,0
the rooms are always open lockers are not included and even if they are only 1000 krw to rent they should be included ,0
the bathrooms are ok however theres only three for about 40 people,0
the room was really hot but if you kept the windows open the breeze helped,0
the staff was amazing and the people we met were equally amazing,0
every morning we had great conversation with people down in the pub,0
food is great and you get a discount for staying there,0
i would recommend this hostel to anyone,0
greeted by a particularly lovely member of staff from adelaide,0
mattress had a dip in the middle so v uncomfortable,0
also guy cleaning room at 7pm and then came back at 10pm to sqirt cleaning products on top of lockers seems like a weird time to clean a room and not something i wanted to breathe in while going to sleep,1
showers looked grubby whole place could do with a really good clean tbh,1
lovely vibe in the place v laid back great music,0
mixed bag really,0
not for anyone over 21 who doesnt like a party,0
nice location however they dont have lift facility,0
while the location was great i would not advise staying here if you want to meet others traveling,0
great value for your money but a weird vibe,0
tiny room decent location,0
we got a double private room japanese style with tatami and futons,0
air quality is pretty poor especially during a humid heat wave with no fans or windows or air filters,0
biggest complaint was even though we put on the do not disturb sign the staff still came by and cleaned our room and folded our underwear,1
what if we had been doing something private or changing,0
what is the point of the sign,0
staff were friendly and willing to help us out with whatever issues we faced,0
bed was a little small for my friendwho is 6 ft tall and hence he had some difficulty sleeping at night,0
id say that if your height is below 5 ft 10 inches you should be able to fit into the bed comfortably,0
they charge 5 pounds as security deposit for the key card and another 5 pound security deposit per padlock you take from them,0
however this is refundable at the time of checkout,0
great location near hyde park,0
bed very comfortable everywhere very clean,1
felt safe and welcomed,0
thank you ,0
i would not recommend this hostel firstly as we were witness to a gang confrontation across the street as we were walking up,0
the staff did not wear any identifying markers and seemed extremely annoyed when approached by anyone,0
while the showers and toilets were clean the room floors were covered in dust,1
there was only one toilet but six showers for the top two floors,0
as sweeney todd said theres a hole in the world like a great black pit ,0
and it goes by the name of london,0
overall the staff was friendly the minute we walked in,0
they were very helpful when it came to recommending sites restaurants and best form of transportation,0
it is centralized to major monuments will have to walk a little but worth the sites,0
great atmosphere,0
met so many people doing the free activities,0
good bar with a great happy hour and the most helpful friendly staff ive come across,0
i heard some rooms could do with an upgrade and there arent lockers for bags but a safe for your valuables,0
but overall a good hostel for a solo traveller,0
great hostel and the staff were really great and helpful,0
bedroom was great nice and spaced out and cages for storage under the bed were a great size,0
the breakfast for 4 euros was worth it considering its all you can eat and the night life was solid too,0
only thing that could be worked on was the bathroom on my floor wasnt the cleanest and smelt bad the whole time ,1
all and all i would definitely recommend to people and would stay here again ,0
thanks a ton,0
very nice hostel next to the central station which is great if you are interailing like me,0
the bedsa are comfy and you have underbed lockers to safety store your things ,0
its a 10  15 minute walk to the main sights of berlin,0
overall i had a good stay here,0
this hostel has everything you need in your room,0
the bar is open all daynight excluding one hour between like 34am,0
only a short walk into berlin for the sites,0
staff were always helpful despite being quite uninterested most of the time ,0
nice vibe with cheap drinks and food available,0
was great place to stay with a lot of asian restaurants near by  close to the metro,0
we arrived with a booking of a mixed dorm room  were upgraded to a twin room  was great  ,0
great place to stay would recommend although a solo female traveller may want to look else where as i found walking back at night to the hostel from the metro a slight bit scary  not the hostels fault great place despite this  enjoyed the stay,0
good atmosphere,0
clean,1
decent location  safe nice neighborhood close to transit yet further from destination 2030 mins ,0
really cool location and nice atmosphere,0
very confusing to find the hostel as there was no sign outside and no one answered the phone,0
everything was perfect also the weather 0â‚¬,0
great hostel if you like architecture because its gorgeous but not quite as good if you want to have a beer and party,0
it was very clean and we had a private room which was quaint but pretty small which was okay because im super agile,1
but it did get quite hot as they are located on the top floor,0
overall its nice if you like catching the tube into the city because there isnt much going on at swiss cottage,0
this is the worst hostel ive stayed in especially given the price,0
it started when they couldnt accept my credit card,0
so i had to go to the atm to get cash yay fees,0
the rooms themselves were awful  no space dirty and uncomfortable thinnest pillows ever,1
the lockers are small under bed and the flimsiest of doors feel like they could easily be broken open ,0
for the price you can find better hostels in london,0
the receptionist was quite rudebut the cleaning staff were very friendly,0
there wasnt proper wifi connection,0
steep stairs makes it difficult to carry luggage upward ,0
kinda okay for very short stay per say 1 or 2 days max ,0
wont recommend though,0
beautiful people cheerful staff amazing location,0
das beste hostel in dem ich jemals Ã¼bernachtet habe  sehr sauber moderne bÃ¤der top lage eine traumhafte dachterrasse sehr gutes frÃ¼hstÃ¼ck und super mitarbeit,0
ich wÃ¼rde hier jederzeit wieder Ã¼bernachten,0
amazing staff who helped us with everything we needed,0
they booked trains for us and answered all our questions and gave us useful tips on getting around the india,0
we were totally lost in india but after our stay at backpackers heaven we felt well prepared for the rest of our journey,0
thanks for everything,0
was a great hostel with great bathroom facilities and dorm rooms,0
however having a kitchen would have been nice particularly as the buffet breakfast is quite expensive,0
even just a fridge to store food would be super helpful,0
ok but not great,0
overall the place was great,0
the only thing that really grossed me out were the mattresses,1
i feel like they should probably invest in some new ones,0
booked a private room here with my girlfriend price was reasonable but all of the hostels in inner city berlin are expensive,0
the place was cool layout a bit wierd,0
hangout spots were pretty sweet,0
the bar was barely cheaper than other places might as well go out,0
we were there wednesday thursday didnt seem too wild on the party scale at all,0
supposedly a rooftop bar party that happens on fridays,0
but we missed it,0
accidentally booked friday night and the staff let us cancel it not charge,0
lovely staff,0
this hostel has the perfect location close to the regents park,0
just an awesome hostel,0
joy and the rest of the staff is super friendly and the overall atmosphere is one the best ive experienced,0
the hutong and the surrounding area is great,0
will definitly come back to here when im in bejing,0
only negative points to mention slow wifi overall cleanliness in rooms could be a bit better,1
the location is brilliant and allows you to diver straight into the culture,0
the staff are fairly friendly and the wifi is wonderful ,0
apart from this there are little facilities our room had bed bugs and was not particularly clean nor did it live up to the pictures ,1
one staff member will also give his best sales pitch to try get you to cancel your plans in favour of what he thinks you should do he earns commission of course best to ignore and stick to your plans if you stay,0
this hostel was lovely  quirky,0
it was in a fab location  lots of local bars nearby,0
the staff were really friendly,0
the kitchen was small but the right size for the hostel so it never felt overcrowded,0
the rooms are very small but theres air conditioning so they werent uncomfortable,0
overall i would stay here again ,0
really understaffed reception resulting in hourlong lines and bad service,0
had a friend who came and stayed with us for one night she had to wait for two hours  to check in,0
difficult to get eg towels and to get to borrow a hair dryer at the reception due to both the long lines and the fact that everything seem to cost extra,0
payed for a private room but still had to argue to get an extra towel without an extra fee had to pay extra to get to place our luggage in an unguarded room etc,0
photos make the place look a lot cleaner and newer than it actually is,1
our trash was never emptied in our room and the day i left i noticed a lot of the trash cans were overflowing,1
i didnt feel there was good communal space other than the kitchen which i didnt really eat there and use other than one or two times,0
i basically left early in the morning and came home really late and just slept and showered there because i didnt enjoy the space,0
had a great stay at the hosteller,0
steven and the rest of the staff were extremely friendly and hospitable,0
location is just ok but worth going for the awesome people who will make sure you have an enjoyable stay,0
showers are joke in this hostel,0
stay away,0
location is okay staying in here means you are on the door step of moulin rouge and a 10 minute walk away from sacre coeur however the road its situated on isnt the nicest,0
although the facilities are great and the staff where always ready to help,0
this hostel is also sandwiched in between two metro stations it was a great option for us as we where inter railing so we arrived and departed from gare du nord which is only a 10 minute walk away if you dont want to brave the metro,0
well located and freshly renovated,0
the dorms are perfect and still cheap,0
the staff is amazing  they helped us a lot they truly enjoy taking care of their hosts,0
the kitchen is also perfect to cook whatever you want and the tatami they have is a great place to chill,0
i recommend it 100,0
thanks for everything,0
as a woman traveling i would not recommend staying here alone,0
if you do please request an all girls dorm,0
the hostel was extremely filthy the staff were unprofessional and there were several creepy men ,1
while i stayed here i did not feel safe or comfortable however the women in my dorm were very nice,0
for one night it should be fine but longer than that i would not recommend it ,0
good place to stay overall in a great location,0
the owner answers my emails and questions very quickly about making a reservation on the same day,0
the rooms are clean and they offer a simple breakfast in the morning,1
great location if you are exploring seoul especially the hongdae area,0
its also right near the metro which connects to the subway line directly to the airport which makes this guesthouse very convenient,0
i will continue to stay here again in the future ,0
staff also spoke english,0
room and bed were okay for a stay for 2 nights in a city like paris,0
what i missed was a bigger social place in the hostel to meet people,0
my stay was satisfactory and i enjoyed my stay,0
solid hostel,0
belushis gets dirty as the night progresses,1
its a party hostel,0
when i first arrived to place it had weird smell throughout the building,1
the places should rated lowered,0
when i initially pick the room and i certain expectation of the room,0
thea picture online was different from in person,0
the picture angle as if you expected that size,0
to have tellpeople living basically our suits case could over the room,0
the towels were not properply cleaned,1
in the shower it had water coming,0
and it was cause weird smell throughoutthe bathroom,1
the location of place ðŸ˜€,0
the people are really nice but the lock on the mens dorm lockers and on the mens room door is enough for me to say you should think about somewhere else first its really annoying,0
bar in the hostel all types of transport around even tho it can be a bit noisy but not really noticeable,0
rooms and bathrooms very clean and lovely staff,1
fairly standard chain hostel in good location,0
the air con in the room didnt function very well as kept having to be emptied of water,0
other guests in room seemed to be mostly longterm so not the best atmosphere,0
great hostel for meeting people  the free drink always brings people down to the bar between 5  7pm where you can meet others and head out to one of the many great places nearby for food and karaoke,0
definitely try the newstyle ramen okinomiyaki and sushi places they recommend,0
also the roof is a cool place to hang out if you want to get beers from the convenience store,0
location was perfect as i prefer a quieter neighbourhood,0
but so easy to access tskiji harajuku shibuya etc on metro,0
the lockers could have been a little bigger as there wasnt much space to store a suitcase,0
it wasnt a huge problem and everything else was great,0
absolutely fantastic place,0
close to the metro great facilities good price and good staff,0
couldnt find anything wrong with this place other then the beds being too hard which seems like a theme in japan,0
the location is amazing,0
except one of the staff who apparently was bored of people others were so nice,0
breakfast was good enough as well,0
however the biggest issue is not having lockers,0
or appropriate place for leaving your stuff,0
it made me very tired carrying all my stuff for two days,0
best hostel ever,0
not only did they accept me despite having previously stayed at a hostel with bed bugs their friendly staff also did everything they could to help me exterminate any bugs or eggs from my belongings by helping me with washing and drying my clothes for free and spraying my backpack,1
the kitchen and garden areas were the perfect place to meet and trade stories with other travelers,0
bit far from city attractions but conveniently close to the tube,0
highly recommend,0
this building is packed,0
plusses and minuses to this but overall,0
i enjoyed my stay,0
very easy for a solo backpacker nice to just drop stuff off and sleep pretty much,0
it is in central london right next to borough market,0
the curtains are a must you can still have some privacy in a shared dorm,0
its right above a metro station and pretty close to shoppings and restaurants,0
they were also kind to accommodate a request of mine ,0
it is a very good hostel,0
good price good personal good location good breakfast comfy rooms,0
the only cons is that there were cockroaches in my room ,1
the staff was very friendly,0
the tattooed girl working there i dont remember her name helped me a lot giving recommendations about places to go and explained how to get to the airport thank you so much,0
great hostel,0
we stayed here for four days private double room,0
we were welcomed by morgan who was very very friendly and gave us all the necessary info and showed us around,0
the place is very clean that includes the showers,1
a small kitchen is available if you like to cook rather than eat out,0
our double room was spacious with cool interior ,0
only gripes  the boxspring bed in the double room is not super comfortable ,0
 the walls are quite thin so you can hear other guests at night ,0
very good hostel,0
stayed in a 10 personall female dorm and adored it,0
location was fantastic staff where on par,0
only complaint is the showers could have used a little extra attention when being cleaned,1
but would 100 return and use their other locations,0
awesome hostel with amazing facilities and large sized rooms,0
bar downstairs is heaps of fun and good atmosphere,0
staff were helpful,0
only downside is the suburb it is located in  quite a dodgy area and a fair walk  train ride into the city centre,0
not many things around the hostel,0
so we spent a fair bit of money on train tickets,0
other than that it was great,0
the hostel and staff were amazing and very helpful,0
 we were giving something completely different than what we booked,0
i guess this is commen,0
the staff didnt seem to care because the only thing that was said was ya,0
its annoying,0
but you still have a bed ,0
towards the end of the conversation they gave us free towels and a drink,0
witch dont get me wrong,0
thats cool and all,0
but i feel that when it came to the pay they switch me into a 4 person room,0
and i had to pay the price,0
my friend  her sister booked a room with 4 beds but got an 8 person,0
clean ,1
solid location ,0
helpful staff ,0
not the most social of hostels,0
ive stayed in  and certainly not a party hostel ,0
nonetheless a great place to make home base as you explore toyko,0
overall this was a really good place to stay,0
it was really noisy during my one night stay but thats because the french soccer team had just won a game,0
the hostel was clean the little interaction i had with staff was friendly and the atmosphere was festive and good for meeting new people,1
the hostel was dirty the bathrooms and toilets were disgusting and unpractical,1
worst of all there were bedbugs in one of the beds and i doubt it was cleaned properly after we notified the staff,1
the reservation went wrong and the staff was not willing to fix the issue,0
there seemed to be zero communication between them,0
keycards were just handed to us whenever we asked staff did not check whether we were indeed staying in that particular room,0
not safe,0
worst hostel i stayed in so far,0
this was my first time staying at a hostel and it made me really want do it again,0
i stayed in the 10bed room  it was much more comfortable than i expected,0
the staff were super friendly  helpful,0
the other guests were extremely friendly  respectful to me and my belongings,0
i was apprehensive about my stuff all out in the open unsecured because they did not have large lockers available but it did not end up being a problem at all,0
overall it was a nice experience and i would stay here again,0
the staff said that they could put my heavy luggage in the storage place and did not,0
the reception is an unsafe place to put it,0
im hoping there was construction going on,0
almost every bathroom on my floor had something wrong with it and out of order signs were everywhere,0
showers were constantly dirt wet and covered in hair,1
room was nice and i appreciated the curtains around the bunk,0
staff was amazing,0
no kitchen or real hangout space sucked a it bout outdoor terrace was nice,0
did appreciate having to pay for lockers since there is no luggage storage if you arrive early or leave late,0
best hostel ive ever stayed in,0
beautiful building,0
massive beds so lots of personal space,0
staff are very relaxed about drinking your own alcohol there is a good big supermarket just down the road on site,0
my boyfriend and i loved our stay here,0
the receptionists were very helpful and friendly,0
the location wasnt too bad either ,0
a feature i did appreciate in the hostel was the travel recommendation boards that recommended local foods and sightseeing areas,0
would definitely stay here again,0
great location and unbelievably clean,1
its easy to meet people here if youre travelling solo,0
i had a nice stay here the only limitation is the lack of hobsoven in the kitchen  also the toilet paper could be a little softer after a weekend in berlin,0
great hostel to meet people when traveling solo,0
will definitely stay there again,0
really nice place in many ways great and friendly staff excellent location for edm clubs or to just hang around cool edgy berliners,0
but it was kind of dirty and there was no hot water,1
sucked not being able to take a real shower for three days,0
hostel was in great location but room wasnt clean ,1
overall it was an average stay,0
great friendly staff,0
clean hotel,1
perfect location,0
no airconditioning ,0
i would not recommend staying there in hot summer monthsat all,0
book through their website its cheaper been backpacking for a year and this hostel is great,0
incredible price for a 6 dorm room and close to everything,0
very clean and free breakfast and other deals,1
would stay again any day,0
this is probably the worst value for money hostel ive stayed at no kitchen and they charge for towels  breakfast lifts so slow i walked to the 10th floor faster than waiting for them,0
the first room i stayed in the power went out,0
i was assured that it would be fixed by the time i got back,0
but it wasnt,0
 i had to change rooms at 3am,0
the room i was moved to had towels all over the floor because the shower had flooded the room,0
stay literally anywhere else,0
the road noise was fairly loud even from the 2nd floor,0
my assigned bed was occupied already upon arriving,0
the only compliment i can give is that the renovated showers are nice,0
the italian girl dont give me the rest of the money,0
honestly best hostel ive ever stayed in,0
the house is beautiful and the staff are great,0
the bar has really cheap drinks and does specials every night,0
its close to the metro and not far from most attractions in the city,0
i had a great experience and highly recommend,0
very nice people,0
we booked for 4 nights and only stayed for two as we decided last minute to stay a night each in agra and jaipur,0
they were kind enough to reimburse us for the two nights we didnt stay,0
aside from that we were very pleased with everything else,0
absolutely fantastic,0
the rooftop terrace has an incredible view over the pyramids and you can order great food drinks including beer and shisha,0
the staff are all super friendly and will make sure you have a good time in cairo ,0
the one thing i didnt like about this hostel was that they have no air conditioning,0
in a room that you are sharing with 12 other people you can imagine trying to sleep in a humid 80 degree environment ,0
the other thing that i didnt like is that the rooms have no lockers,0
so everyone leaves their backpacks out in the open hoping that the last person out locks the room,0
i came from a hostel in rome which had air conditioning and individual lockers in the room,0
the breakfast is actually good,0
top location atmosphere and service,0
excellent breakfast buffet though the price seems to change from the reception 7eur to the lift 650eur to the actual breakfast room 750eur,0
a bit of consistency in messaging would be useful ,0
the hostel also claims that this hostel is more suitable for people under 40 years old,0
whats with the ageism,0
whats so special with being under or over 40,0
some more sensitive wording worthy of the 21st century in a city like berlin would be useful ,0
we were on a 6 bed female dorm,0
it was impossible to sleep,0
all night people in an out banging the door up and down the beds no respect whatsoever for the ones sleeping,0
a nightmare really,0
i couldnt leave any earlieralso think the bar could be open a little bit longer on a friday night,0
went there to have a beer and at 0145 he said he wouldnt serve us as it was closing,0
the location is perfect and it is cheap,0
thats about it,0
it was alright for the money spent good atmosphere and decently clean,1
though security is not the best,0
i was told upon arrival that past 11 the front door would be locked and to get it open we would have to ring the bell and the superintendent would be there to open it,0
however after a night out i arrived back at the hostel at 3am to find that the front door was open and the superintendent was asleep with his door closed,0
the rest of the staff i interacted with were pleasant,0
the location is worth the extra money i have stayed at both of their locations in paris and this one is better because the location is so much better and very close to the subway,0
there is a party every night in the courtyard bar so if you dont like that then ask for a room that does not face the inside,0
overall a great experience,0
the staff never changed the sheets from the previous customer or the towels the whole time i was there,1
the security boxes were also broken,0
its a good location but the trains are loud at night and the buses start early so it can be hard to sleep,0
decent self kitchen though,0
the staff here are amazing not only do they get work done but they are fun and friendly,0
very clean they clean every morning,1
you need help with something,0
ask seokgyu hell help you to the best of his abilities,0
want something to eat,0
the ask and theyll tell you places that deliver to the hostel,0
really great place cant wait fo come back again,0
very well located 15 min walk to the eiffel tower metro station just a few steps away from hostel,0
lots of options for eating out and to buy groceries,0
staff was very friendly and helpful,0
ac and internet worked good,0
good atmosphere to meet fellow travelers,0
booked this hostel last minute due to a delayed flight  wanted to sight see in london the next day,0
the directions online were easy enough  staff was very helpful when i arrived even with directions to reading,0
there was no acfans in the scorching hot rooms,0
i got a small plastic fan for a deposit but it was still hard to sleep,0
uncomfortable beds hot rooms  loud street below with the open windows as ambulances drove by  drunk people were loud until 4am,0
close to attractions though,0
had a great stay,0
would recommend,0
they charged you everything,0
brilliant hostel good location good staff friendly and sociable atmosphere parking organised trips and pub crawls etc would highly recommend ,0
only downside they only allow minimum 2 nights stay would have liked to have stayed again the night before my flight home,0
it was a great hostel,0
the staff is extremely nice its 10 minutes walk from hyde park and 5 minutes walk from the tube,0
i wan in the doorms and it was very clean and roomy,1
the ac worked great hottest summer ever,0
a great hostel ,0
everyones welcoming and friendly,0
from the security staff to the receptionists to the bar staff ,0
private rooms are great and the atmosphere in the bar downstairs is amazing ,0
a great weekend stay and would definitely recommend as a place to stay,0
great place to stay if you only want the basics,0
very clean quiet,1
excellent location,0
wonderfully historic building,0
would stay again,0
cool modern style and pretty clean ,1
my only critique is the elevator is so small and soo slow ,0
you can only use steps to move between certain floors ,0
i liked this hostel a lot,0
the atmosphere was really cool and there were always events going on,0
i stayed here in the summer so just be aware that it gets pretty hot without airconditioning,0
otherwise i had a great time,0
i was traveling with my partner so the capsules afforded a quasiprivate room at a fairly reasonable price in a great location,0
although because you have to book two beds the cost ended up being comparable to a hotel,0
24 hour reception is nice,0
the bar downstairs runs until 3 am most nights and you can hear the thumping of the music in the capsule room,0
if youre out to party or if you can sleep with a little ruckus great place not the best for light sleepers who want to sleep early,0
add air con in rooms stay need to be nicer lower the price as its definitely not worth the prices we paid,0
i stayed for a night in a 6 bed room with ensuite bathroom,0
the bathroom was nice and clean,1
the receptionist was friendly and helpful,0
the location is really close to the forbidden city and tiananmen sq so quite central,0
i would stay there again,0
cool location in old delhi truly experience the real indian capital city ,0
bathrooms a little dirty but insane air con in the dorms ,1
amazing staff who will do all to help ,0
great place to stay,0
the staff were friendly and helpful,0
the rooms were clean and so were the toiletsshowers,1
the hostel was within walking distances to most places including the london eye so the location was great,0
there was a discount on food but not alcohol at the pub but still it was nice to come back and have a drink and not have to leave to walk home,0
overall a great place,0
great location clean bathrooms good value breakfast 4 euros for continental style,1
definitely a bit of a party hostel if thats what youre looking for,0
overall had a really nice time here,0
the staff were very polite and helpful,0
bar at night was nice great way to connect with others and had great talks with the staff,0
the ac in the rooms was great,0
the location is a bit out of the way but close to the subway to get you to where you need to go,0
really enjoyed my stay,0
pretty close to a lot of tourist spots,0
id probably prefer to stay in kreuzberg which is more my personal style artys fartys,0
this place is cute tho for a basic hostel,0
great location and value for money but i would not recommend this hostel,0
i stayed in a room in the basement which is scary as almost no sunlight reach in the room,0
some rooms i walked pass were really smelly,1
every tap on sink and shower is like a 2second running tap and you will have to keep pressing,0
cheap price stay for cheapest material possible,0
it was very hot in summer night with no air con and crowded room too,0
invest a little bit more for a better accommodation,0
if you want to meet people and have a place that you will call home while you are in berlin book a room in u inn hostel,0
thank you for everything ,0
the hostel is in a great location the staff is nice and very helpful the bathrooms were always clean and wifi actually worked,1
this hostel provides great value considering its about half the price of the other hostels in the downtown area,0
keep in mind this is not a party hostel it had a social vibe but never got rowdy,0
its also very simple to get to from the airport takes like 40 mins and 3 dollars the taxi driver at the airport wanted 60 dollars,0
convenient location next to the train station and the staff were extremely kind and helpful,0
the rooms are clean and comfortable and the hostel has a nice atmosphere,1
it would have been nice if there was a kitchen available to guests eating out in paris every day gets quite expensive,0
i also didnt always feel safe enteringleaving the hostel as one of the hostel security guards had a tendency to catcall female guests and make comments that made me extremely uncomfortable,0
excellent hostel,0
it was really nice and fun to sleep inamongst the books,0
everything was spotless and the location great,0
will add tho that i felt there was more care put into the image and vibe of the place than comfort and ammenities etc just think of it like sleeping in a gentrified coffee shop ,0
this was only a tiny thing tho and would recommend for the experience,0
best to come as a solo traveller couple as there was a sort of tabboo regarding talking in the common area,0
egyptian night was a lovely place that provided great security and facilities,0
the staff especially were very helpful and friendly imparticular ahmed who organised our tour through all the pyramids in cairo,0
the breakfast in the morning was lovely as they provided tea and fresh food,0
the location also was very helpful as it is only a very short distance from the egyptian museum,0
overall i would highly recommend ,0
ahmed is a legend,0
unfortunately i only stayed here for one night,0
atmosphere is honestly the greatest aspect of this hostel  i finished a book in one sitting despite my attention span problems just by being here,0
the bed doesnt really stand out from any hostels but i had no complaints and slept like a baby,0
sleeping in a bookshelf was really cool but the novelty wears off in extended duration trips,0
hostel can be hard to find though ,0
its at the 78th floor of a building,0
very clean 24 hour check in bar lockers laundry facility,1
bed was clean,1
very helpful staff,0
i stayed at the 4bunk mixed dorm,0
the room was extremely small and it was not really possible for everyone to open up bags move around etc,0
it was also pretty hot inside,0
the electric sockets were pretty far from the bed and there were no reading lights etc,0
but toilets were really clean,1
staff was very friendly and location is also good lots of nice cafes and pubs around,0
good location but a bit expensive for what you get,0
breakfast was pretty basic but the worst part was that i was put on the 5th floor with no elevator,0
and i had a ton of heavy luggage,0
they do have a storage room on the first floor which helped but there was a massive heat wave and with no ac and just a small window that didnt provide any airflow it felt like a sauna every night and must have been 30c in our room,0
sure it would be much better in the winter or a cooler summer,0
tiny kitchen but the essentials are there,0
teamwork is necessary to have more than one person cooking,0
only real drawback is the quality of the washing dryer expensive because one machine doesnt work and i didnt know until i asked,0
great people place and super close to 2 tube stations plenty of places to eat and grocery stores,0
thanks for a great week in london,0
by far one of the best hostels i have stayed in,0
rooms and bathrooms comfy and very clean good location and self service breakfast really social common area and rooftop to meet people,0
the staff and volunteers are were great fun organising social events every few night,0
they were knowledgeable with the area and helpful with whatever you needed,0
the hostel felt like home and the staff and guests were definitely were the highlight of my stay in seoul,0
smelly room,1
filthy bathrooms,1
people loitering around the entrance of hostel ,0
the staff member was lovely upon checking in but the one we got when checking out did not even speak a word ,0
location is great but doesnt make it worth it for such an uncomfortable stay ,0
my boyfriend and i got up especially early just to leave the place,0
it was such a great and convenient place which was close to the underground railway and bus stations,0
the staff were the loveliest people and they were very helpful,0
my only problem was that the room was really hot because there werent any air conditioners or fans and the lounge area didnt help as well,0
but it was overall a pleasant stay,0
apart from the proximity to new delhi railway station theres nothing good about this hostel,0
its actually a hotel with soom rooms turned into dorms,0
theres no sign of hostel culture a backpacker expects and dorms are crammed with 8 beds with no space to even walk,0
the place has no common area where people could socialise with each other,0
excellent location and facilities however the summer heat combined with the noise from the bar downstairs made it difficult to sleep,0
bit of a walk from train station but still a nice enough location,0
keycards for entry made us feel safe and there was relatively cheap drinks at the bar and vending machine,0
the kitchen facilities consisted of a fridge and thats it,0
staff were very friendly and helpful,0
only thing is that it was weirdly difficult to close the door to the room,0
would still recommend though,0
ive been in way better hostels as well as in way worse ones,0
if this hostel was in a more central position i would give 910 rating,0
to be fair though not being in the city centre has not been much of a hassle because when you visit a city you generally move around a lot so a metro daily ticket is the normality,0
really enjoyed my stay here,0
the cleanliness was awesome,1
i saw people always cleaning ,1
the atmosphere was great and i made a friend,0
the loungebar downstairs was a great place to hang out have drinks and food,0
the rooms were nice also,0
the beds having curtains for privacy was a nice touch and i really appreciated that ,0
the staff was always super helpful and friendly which really made me feel at home,0
i will definitely stay here in the future,0
brilliant stay the beds were a bit too cramped in room,0
so me and my boyfriend were both on top bunks so the people at the bottom left us no space to put anything,0
staff are lovely overall enjoyed our stay,0
great location friendly and helpful staff extremely clean and great facilities,1
great location,0
really friendly staff,0
didnt get a chance to hang out in common room but seemed like it had a good social scene,0
bit expensive but seems to be the going rate in london,0
also semi annoying that you cannot have any food inside the rooms but the upside is that everything is super clean,1
would stay again,0
feels quite safe for a solo female traveller,0
excellent location very close to a underground train tram and 20 minute walk from museum island,0
very secure lockers and comfortable beds,0
the staff were extremely friendly and the kitchen is the best ive visited so far,0
the only negative was the cleanliness of the bathroom and that you cant go on the outside roof at night overall lovely stay and lively rooftop bar would come again ,1
as others have said as well this hostel is quite large and it has somewhat of a hotel feel to it due to the size,0
however its paris and generator is a large and well known hostel chain,0
the roof top bar was fantastic and the location was great,0
the only thing that i could fault is the fact that there are no lockers in your room and if you dont bring your own lock you can only purchase one,0
they have paid lockers available there to rent on a lower floor and that worked ok,0
i stayed here at the last minute but i had a lovely time,0
i was worried about a lack of curtains around the beds but it was fine,0
i would stay here again,0
great location and very large space ,0
recommend if you are staying for few days in berlin,0
guys at the desk were really helpful and friendly and welcoming,0
rooms were very clean,1
only small downer was abrupt ending of breakfast every morning,0
great people and atmosphere,0
i felt like home,0
dont miss the chance to come here while in delhi,0
feels more like a boutique hotel than a hostel but this fit our needs well,0
staff was friendly roomfacilities were nice and clean,1
the cafebar downstairs was great too,0
location is a little out of the way of some of the major tourist sites eg shibuya shinjuku harajuku area but the hostel is 510 minute walk to several different stations so its not too bad and its close to other tourist sites such as akihabara tokyo skytree tokyo station etc,0
a great hostel for those travelling on a more modest budget those looking for some familiar accents run by aussieskiwi or those looking for a friendly base hostel ,0
the staff went above and beyond and were always helpful,0
the facilities were kept clean thanks mia and elvis and the barreception was always staffed by a friendly face ,1
wifi was good lockers were big enough for valuables dorm doors locked with swipe cards,0
great hostel  see yall again in august,0
this was my first hostel experience and it was absolutely amazing,0
the staff were extremely kind and welcoming,0
both the staff and other guests were all very friendly and sociable i easily met people and made friends,0
theres a pub in the bottom of the hostel free dinners free day activities drinking games as a group and fun nights out,0
i would come back to london just for this hostel,0
thank you from canada,0
the location of this hostel was great for my boyfriend and i as we had two early morning trains during our stay,0
the train station is only a 35 minute walk away,0
our 4 bed mixed dorm was clean and the beds comfortable,1
i love the pod type styled beds,0
the only downsides of this hostel are that its located in a sketchy area as other reviews had stated and the club is quite loud,0
the ear plugs provided were definitely necessary,0
all and all this place was a great choice for our stay in paris,0
hostel was good,0
nice location and 5 kind walk to victoria coach station,0
the only issue i saw was bathrooms were not clean,1
things we loved  staff were really helpful and friendly  rooftop seating area  close to the metro ,0
we stayed one night and overall it was great the bathroom facilities were a little old,0
so didnt look very clean i would say the bathrooms in general could have been a little cleaner,1
staff were lovely and so helpful and our beds were comfy ,0
definitely a place for seasoned travellers as opposed to those that arent very confident owing to the street outside,0
we did enjoy our stay ,0
this hostel is great but really needs self catering facilities as you cant have food in the rooms breakfast is expensive at â‚¬6 for ham bread and cornflakes and they charge â‚¬5 to take some for lunch,0
security is great  two key card doors to get to your room and lockers no padlocks though,0
staff are lovely and facilities are very clean,1
the common area is massive so its quite hard to meet people easily,0
but you still can,0
incredible location,0
shower and bathroom was dirty and the stairs had a bad smell,1
rooms and common area were ok though,0
very overcrowded and stuffy in the rooms in summer,0
sheets dont seem the cleanest,1
the location and breakfast included is convinent,0
has all the necessary basics working showers wifi and secure rooms,0
great hostel one of the best i have stayed in ever,0
great location on the edge of friedrichschain near all the cool bars and the berlin wall ,0
great bar friendly and helpful staff and even a cool sculpture garden in the middle ,0
stayed with a group of 18 as part of a stag do,0
we had a wonderful time,0
great hostel,0
ungodly hot in the room at night,0
bar was nice and short walk to nice little area and right beside the train station so pretty good access,0
the bar was ok,0
great hostel i stayed in a twin private and it was just like a hotel room,0
location is also great couple of blocks away from tower hill subway station wich will conect you anywhere around london ,0
for 5 pounds you have a very complete breakfast that its totally worth it compare to londons bars prices,0
its a very busy hostel and sometimes it could be hard to use the kitchen atmosphere,0
if you wanna meet some travellers you will definitley do because the bar is always full of people,0
i knew i was booking a budget hostel for that price however the standard of cleanliness was shocking,1
a really bad smell through out the whole room as well as showers,1
none of the floors were clean and the bathrooms were in a really bad state there wasnt even any working soap,1
the location is pretty average with not much food around and the supermarkets are all closed on a sunday in the area,0
only stayed one night but honestly wish i booked somewhere else,0
friendly staff clean and comfy bunk beds well equipped kitchen area,1
the shower in 005 room we were staying in looked extremely neglected dirty and had hot water just for a brief moment,1
showers on other floors were clean and tidy though,1
ridiculous that a 2 single bed room gets turned into a 8 bed dorm,0
no air to breathe and no way of falling asleep because of how hot it is,0
windows only opens up an inch and no fans or air con in the room,0
not to mention the fact you have to pay for your sheets,0
because every backpacker is carrying around spare sheets with them genius,0
absolute scam,0
only positive thing i have to say is that the shower was decent,0
besides that im never staying at ao again,0
value for money is shocking,0
cool vibed hostel though i thought more would be on at the attached bar than there was during my stay,0
overall had a good experience,0
the hostel surpassed my expectations the location was amazing as there are both the sbahn and the underground stations nearby,0
and its in a really hip and interesting neighbourhood  very chill loads of graffiti funky cafes clubs the riverbank  the spot for watching sunsets ,0
is literally 3mins away the staff was super friendly and helpful too the hostel is generally definitely kept to a high standard of cleanliness and general facilities,1
awesome location and amazing breakfast,0
the staff are great and super nice ,0
pros amazing breakfast good value ,0
helpful staff ,0
good location ,0
good travelers ,0
ac cons ,0
elevator breaks down frequently ,0
some construction ,0
not great wifi in rooms ,0
i couldnt find a very comfortable place to work which for me is important,0
most travelers dont care about this though ,0
overall excellent value for your money,0
i recommend this place,0
highly recommend this hostel,0
it is very clean the front desk staff are super friendly and spoke great english,1
met some good people here in the common spaces,0
its in a very relaxed neighborhood but close to good food and less than a 20 minute train ride from just about anywhere you want to go,0
two thumbs up,0
this hostel is pretty good if you have your expectations set correctly,0
it is a budget hostel in a trendy parisian neighborhood,0
so the rooms are small as most rooms are in paris the breakfast is limited but it is perfectly fine for the price youre paying and the hostel doesnt have extra amenities,0
however the wifi signal is reliable,0
the hostel is within 3 minutes walking distance to two metro stations that can get you to most of the sites in the city,0
and montmartre is very fun,0
the hostel has a great location just next to subway station and on the piccadilly line that goes to heathrow,0
pub has a great atmosphere ,0
most of the rooms are on the 3rd floor which is difficult for a guest with a luggage like me as there are no elevators and you cant go directly up,0
my room had 3 triple bunk beds in a fairly small area,0
there is no chair or anything in the room and its hard to change clothes or sit on a tripple bunk bed,0
finally for what i paid its a good london hostel,0
i had a really great time here it was quiet the bed was comfy and i met a few cool people,0
the room was extremely small,0
i had a 4bed private and i swear it had like 8m2 in total,0
best option if you are coming to tokyo,0
so central and easy to get all over the city,0
great value for money good facilities for what you pay,0
nice big windows was a real bonus during summer close to a lot of restaurants and subway line but a little far away from the main attractions  clubs luckily the public transport in berlin is one of the best,0
worst hostel i stayed in my life ,0
checkin is only from 4 to 10 pm,0
if not you have to leave your passport to a very rude man until you leave ,0
price is not true,0
they force you to pay a fee to be part of their community beds are not ready you have to make your own bed,0
no bed sheets in the room ,0
no close plugs no personal light dirty bathrooms nonexistent staff breakfast is just stale bread with marmalade and coffee no hostel atmosphere ,1
the ony possitive point point is location ,0
a bit too cold in the room sometimes because the air conditioner is running permanently and if you stop it it turns itself on after a while,0
its a very commercial hostel,0
feels like a hotel i prefer the smaller hostels especially for solo travel,0
location is ok its close to a nice canal where people will picnic and have drinks at night which was nice,0
the bar is good for meeting people at night,0
absolutely loved kaisu,0
the staff was amazing and the all female dorm was perfect for me and a friend,0
i was able to store my bags in their luggage storage for a small fee my entire stay in japan,0
when i left to kyoto and nagoya,0
i left my heavy bags and took a smaller backpack with me and was able to have a hassle free journey without worry because of it,0
this was a great hostel for solo travelers,0
clean and located in a quiet neighborhood 2 stops from alexanderplatz subway station,0
its accessible from many parts of the city and offers tours and bar crawls,0
the free walking tour is definitely worth it,0
great lounge area and kitchen,0
fantastic hostel met some amazing people during my stay,0
absolutely one of my favorite hostels of the trip ,0
right next door to the jr line and just down the street from the tokyo metro station and right in the heart of the sumo scene in tokyo ,0
the staff was amazingly accommodating and friendly ,0
loved it will absolutely stay here again when im in tokyo,0
filthy badly maintained but super convenient location,1
there was dust all over the floor the garbage bin was overflowing,1
some hours after we checked in the room had had been half heartedly swept but was still dirty,1
some of the bathrooms were very smelly some showers did not have a handle for the shower head or hooks for clothes,1
i would only suggest staying here if you just need a place to sleep before getting on a train at euston station early the next day,0
it was an unpleasant experience,0
great place to stay nice atmosphere,0
will be back,0
best location possible you can see it from one of the most accessible metro stations right in the student district of seoul,0
easy atmosphere to meet fell travellers and the hostess sabrina is an absolute gem she really goes out of her way to help you navigate seoul and encourages people to mingle in a nice friendly spot,0
they tried to charge you for everythinglockers 10 euros no place to leave bags,0
till check in for free scale,0
the bathrooms were not clean at all,1
they didnt have kitchen either other common spaces,0
the dorms were good,0
far away from downtown 4km,0
the staff that cleaned the bathroom shouted at me in french like for ten minutes i never understood why,0
however the recepcionist was nice when telling her what happenned,0
it disappointed me the experience was really lower than what i expected,0
ive had such an amazing experience at the hostel,0
met some awesome people from all over the world  exchanged stories  made friends for life,0
this was the best place ever for my 1st hostel experience,0
such humility mutual respect  oh the clean place 1010,1
gratitude for making our stay there joyous cant thank you all enough,0
all the best,0
 well be returning soon yen  riekie stay awesome guys much love,0
jun  jin for the website presidents  of course yen  riekie the vice presidents,0
nice place ,0
breakfast is free ,0
bar is great ,0
they need to clean showers twice a day ,1
ideal location and very welcoming staff ,0
its a very basic setup but all i could ask for given the combination of a great price and great location,0
i love the facilities staffs and everything,0
the air ventilation in the room could be improved but everything else is perfect,0
fantastic stay great location spotlessly clean would stay again,1
everyone here was quite helpful with planning within cairo and beyond ordering food and giving recommendations,0
the hostel is centrally located near the egyptian museum and one of the best cheap restaurants in the city,0
my personal favorite detail apart from the cool staff was the free breakfast with tea every morning,0
nice ðŸ‘ food was amazing specially tea location is a bit away from metro,0
but its ok once u reach the hostel,0
every thing is nearby ,0
massive hostel with quirky decor which i liked,0
a very sociable hostel with a lively bar,0
lots of bathrooms which were cleaned daily,1
the dorm rooms had lockers next to each bed which was great,0
only downside was the other people sharing our dorm who were noisy late at night and didnt like us waking up early,0
so earplugs are a must,0
solid hostel with a great rooftop,0
wish they had security cameras in the luggage storage room but other than that its a good spot,0
stayed in a 4 bed dorm with bathroom for 4 nights ,0
it was clean and spacious had natural light and ac ,1
the staff and guest are all really friendly ,0
basic breakfast coffee juice granola croissant buttered roll is included ,0
you can leave your bags in a locked closet before or after you check in ,0
there are a few metro stations bars restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance ,0
there is not really a common arealounge,0
great private room fully facilitated with a lovely balcony,0
however the overall location of the hostel was seemingly dodgy,0
loud music played often and it seemed unsafe walking to the hostel at night,0
great staff and close by to a metro station,0
the lockers were a little but confusing to use but overall everything else was great,0
made friends here easily and would stay here again,0
honestly one of the best hostels ive ever been to,0
the staff were super friendly and helpful and the vibe is just so incredible,0
the rooms are clean and comfortable and theres even a kitchen for cooking,1
staying there felt like a home away from home,0
its a bit far out from downtown but its so close to public transit that its worth the extra 10 minutes or so on the tram ,0
1010 would recommend,0
me and my boyfriend stayed in the hostel for 2 nights and we really eanjoyed our stay there,0
its in a great location close to nightlife and other major sightseeing places,0
hostel staff were friendly and helpful,0
our 6 bed dorm was clean with great showers,1
hostel sells padlocks for storing luggage in the room so you might wanna bring your own,0
would deffenetley come again,0
i booked the female room with my friend then i dont know what happened,0
but we could use one room only for us,0
it was so quiet and clean room ,1
only one thing the shower water didnt come out very well yet the other things were perfect,0
good place,0
max and enrico are a pair of the greatest hosts ive met so far,0
they sit you down to give you all the great tips about traveling in berlin  local nightlife and food hotspots and museums  something that is lacking in other hostels,0
the rooms are excellent and the atmosphere is friendly and welcoming especially if you are traveling on your own  there is always someone new to meet and enrico and max are around too ,0
my stay in berlin was all the more amazing because of the viertelvier,0
i was in a 6bedroom with ensuite bathroom,0
the room was quite spacious with usb socket and a little lamp for each bunk bed,0
the basement floor has a laundry room a kitchen with free ingredients like pasta oil and spices a nice bar to meet with other travellers,0
a local supermarket is only 200m from the hostel to buy water and ready to eat food,0
my flight was at night and the hostel let me leave my luggage in their luggage room free of charge,0
overall  a great hostel,0
awesome hostel that is close to haneda airport and offers free shuttle service,0
it is really convenient for staying overnight to catch a flight at those odd hours,0
better than expected,0
it wasnt real clean in the room but the lobby and bathrooms were fine ,1
breakfast spread was good,0
first time ever drinking coffee from a bowl  haha ,0
will stay again,0
our stay here was decent ,0
pros 1,0
kitchen area ,0
2,0
location wasnt bada few diff,0
metro locations close by and walkable to sites ,0
3,0
had bathroomsshowers on each floor ,0
4,0
felt safe ,0
cons ,0
1,0
room felt a little cramped for a 6 person bed in my opinion ,0
2,0
started out with one fan then got a second ,0
3,0
the lounge area near the reception area was so hot and small ,0
4,0
the metal storage bins were extremely loud if someone was leaving in a hurry ,0
5,0
two extension cords powering stuff,0
doesnt feel like a hostel  but okay to stay at,0
the staff were so friendly and helpful,0
hostel is clean and comfortable nice breakfast and location is walking distance from some good bars and restaurants,1
hi just letting yall know the private room is not worth it ,0
ours was in the basement with a small window that led to the kitchen leaving us our luggage clothes smelling like food,1
we had no air conditioning in the middle of a heatwave and we had to ask if they had any fans we were not offered any ,0
there were rats in the gardencommon area just at the kitchen door and around the tables where people were eating,1
the corridors were super dirty full of hair and dust ,1
there were no lockers in the bedrooms,0
there were some small lockers in the reception but you had to pay for it and definitely wouldnt fit a backpack or luggage,0
in order to use cutlery or kitchen utensils we had to give an id and take only those items,0
overall the hostel was not clean would never recommend,1
security was top notch with you requiring a swipe card for access everywhere,0
the facilities were super clean and modern i did stay in a private double ensuite however,1
unfortunately it wasnt the greatest sleep due to london going through a heat wave and the hostel having no ac although thats kind of normal for london,0
location was good if your looking for somewhere near brick lane ect but id stay more inner central next time personally,0
very good and clean hostel,1
around 10 minutes walk to asakusa station,0
the staff there were travellers which was fun and also meant they were willing to hang out ,0
the showerbathroom was a bit grim ,1
we had to pay for water ,0
the location was good there is a lot of transport around restaurants  clubs ,0
other people staying were cool ,0
its called a party hostel but the police were called when people sat and chatted outside the hostel on the stairs so it isnt really partyish ,0
at night a bunch of people gather to go out clubbing for the night which is cool,0
good value for money,0
its ok for 12 nights,0
i really liked this hostel,0
i thought the roof top was cool ,0
the curtains on the bed provided great privacy,0
i wish the room or bathroom had a long length mirror,0
we were 5 in a room of 6,0
three lockers were broken and we were told by the staff at reception to deal with it and even offer to put some of our valuable staff in a safe there,0
well okay ,0
but while doing the check in a big old man ernest was being rude as hell,0
he did not tell us anything about the place,0
when asked to pay i pulled out my phone for apple pay,0
he was bewildered and screamed at me gimme your card,0
he was violent the whole time and ended up literally screaming at me,0
dont stay here if you have other options,0
the location was pretty good but the rooms were so hot it was miserable to sleep in them,0
if youre over 61 you probably wont fit in the bunk beds,0
im 63 and i had to hang my legs off the side,0
overall a very mediocre place to stay,0
made some great friends and had an amazing time,0
the bar there is also great,0
the hostel is nice and located in chilled and cool neighborhood,0
but most of the places i was going i was taking 30min to get ,0
the staff are nice and helpful ,0
the shared room is a bit too hot in the summer and there was no courtains ,0
the private room was good there was a small fan inside but the mattress was a bit old,0
not so confortable ,0
and when i arrived the trash bin was full and there were some bottles in the room which makes me think it wasnt well cleaned before ,1
couldnt get the wifi to work but we didnt spend much time in the hostel anyway,0
i was not a huge fan of making up my own bed but it was also not that big a deal,0
wombats was in a great location and the rooftop bar happy hours was especially good,0
easy to use lockers,0
rooms could get pretty hot,0
staff were knowledgeable and friendly,0
all you can eat breakfast was pretty cheap and a bonus,0
had a perfect stay with the dustin guest house,0
sabrina was accommodating and so helpful throughout,0
will definitely use again the next time i come to korea,0
great hostel id recommend to anyone,0
in a great location the rooms are large and spacious and the staff is really friendly,0
the cleaners were great and really lovely,0
the only downside is that the showers were a little dirty and prison looking but it was fine,1
great environment great staff and very good location,0
definitely would stay again,0
very clean bedrooms and bathrooms,1
this was the first time ive stayed at a hostel and it exceeded my expectations,0
we have a round trip out of paris but are backpacking all over europe and will definitely try to stay here our last night,0
this hostel was so clean and such a great environment it was a bit of a ways from central paris but the train is only a 2 minute walk and is super easy to use,1
this hostel really did make our experience in paris much better since nothing was going our way,0
stayed here for 2 nights,0
atmosphere was great and everyone was lovely,0
so convenient having the pub right downstairs for drinks and food also a bonus 25 of brunch menu for guests that includes smashed avo,0
lockers are provided and you require a code to enter hostel and your room,0
location is ideal,0
right next to a tube station and a short walk to the london eye,0
the cleaner comes daily and cleans all bathrooms and bedrooms very friendly and does a great job,1
will definitely be back,0
hostel is well located staff is very friendly and the building is brand new,0
two mais problems not so many social interations bar music in social room areas etc and neither social room nor the badrooms had air condition and it was very hot and unpleasent to sleep,0
the place is cute with really friendly staff,0
its very clean and the roomsbunks are spacious,1
its in a great location 5m from a station and its surrounded by cafes restaurants and shopping,0
the free breakfast tops off the whole experience ,0
there are security boxes but you do need your own lock,0
i didnt realize this when i came not sure how clearly it was listed on the site,0
apart from that it might just be my favorite hostel in tokyo,0
we visited during one of the hottest times of the summer however the room was inhumanely hot and i didnt sleep the whole time i was there which kind of diffeats the purpose of staying at a hostel,0
half of the time the toilets wouldnt flush,1
the first time i showered the water was cold and it kept going in and out,0
there would be water with no water pressure then no water at all,0
the second time i took a shower the water heater was broken so the water was cold,0
the hostel was fun though,0
the staff here were great and they were willing to help you with just about anything,0
the beds were all very comfortable with usb ports on every bed which was very useful,0
the only complaints that id have are that the hostel was quite a ways away from the nearest tube station and that the security lockers werent for all your stuff but rather just for a wallet and passport,0
otherwise id say it was pretty good,0
best hostel ever,0
ridiculously social with the killer bar downstairs awesome showers curtains over the beds literally right next to a metro stop and the food discounts are a lifesaver,0
highly highly recommend,0
close to gare du nord making it easy to get everywhere,0
place is clean and very nice,1
air con in the rooms was great,0
really great value for such a perfect location in london,0
staff were all super friendly and cheerful,0
my 6 bed female dorm was spotless spacious and quiet,1
having separated shower and toilet rooms inside the dorm was very handy plus there are extra bathrooms on the floor,0
only downside was the wifi was only available in the reception area but it was fast and free,0
they have a good activities schedule as well and the guests there were all really friendly,0
pros efficient service you get what you pay for clean free simple breakfast very convenient location close to the station great amenities and facilities quiet and peaceful ,1
cons,0
for my travel partner he did not like the hard beds,0
but i didnt mind them,0
i liked that there werent bunk beds at least in the room i stayed in,0
it kind of sucked that the toilet was on a different floor but with old buildings you get what you get,0
rooms were cleaned every day and staff was helpful,1
most importantly it felt safe,0
this place is so nice,0
i really enjoyed my stay here with my friends,0
we started at this hostel some weeks ago and we stopped at this hostel,0
when you need to take a chill from all the noise go to this place ,0
its a great place for few nights,0
we didnt have an issue checking in as there was someone at reception at that time,0
but i can imagine previous situations or concerns as there really dont seem to be people at reception most of the time,0
but theres a phone number for that purpose,0
breakfast was free and more than enough facilities were clean,1
theres a huge common area with tables and couches and few tables in a garden,0
will definitely come back again,0
clean and comfortable place and really fun and caring staff  thanks,1
yuki,0
great place to stay in shinjuku ,0
great in every way ,0
great cheering staff ,0
great kitchen ,0
great breakfast,0
room with weak lighting and limited space,0
the double bed came in a bunker with a single bed on top of us hitting our head every time we went to bed,0
theres only a small window and this limited ventilation,0
the shower room has poor hygiene with constantly wet floor,1
theres also no control over the water temperature as well,0
i will not personally recommend this hostel,0
5n ensuite 6b f dorm but got 4b ,0
good location and 24h staff fast wifi but only avail in common areas personal plug at each bedside lockers,0
large selfcater kitchen and a separate common area where they also serve food,0
events held but most people did their own thing lots of families so not much of a social atmosphere,0
comfy beds,0
cleanish need to empty garbages more frequently ,1
fixed shower heads had lime buildup and sprayed inconsistently in random directions  please fix this,1
the worst i know the saying you get what you pay for however i thought it would be better than what was offered at this hostel,0
didnt feel safe and happy it was only a night,0
the facities were good and the ac was great in the rooms,0
there wasnt really a great atmosphere and staff didnt provide you with a lot of guidence of the city,0
we had a great stay very kind and friendly staff a really good environment for my 4 year old,0
overall great hostel,0
the service was lovely and the hostel had a good general vibe,0
the lift was broken when i was there which made the floor flights of stairs very unpleasant,0
there also isnt airconditioning or alot of airflow,0
the rooms were quite hot,0
beds were comfortable though,0
i stayed here for 4 nights and extended my stay for 4 more loved every bit of it ,0
amazing and friendly staff,0
they are available 24Ã—7 for any help,0
rooms and beds are very comfortable,0
great people around  located in central cant ask for more,0
home away from home,0
loved my stay here  bed was comfortable and the breakfast was great,0
would definitely stay here again ,0
nice clean hostel with good vibes and friendly staff,0
but rooms arent the biggest and the noise from the road outside is insane even with ear plugs in,0
not enough showers or toilets,0
this place has everything and it is close to many stations ,0
i have stayed here a few times and i like it a lot ,0
you will be happy with your choice ,0
one new thing though is an 1100 curfew which was new this time ,0
there is a sign that says that coming in later can be arranged,0
the hostel is comfortable and easy going staff is super nice and rooms are spacious clean toilets and showers,1
would definetely recommend,0
nice place,0
it will be perfect if the bathrooms temperature to be cooler,0
unfortunately there was a bedbug infestation in my room,1
the staff member who first responded to the problem was very helpful so i appreciated that,0
however i didnt get the sense that the hostel was going to take any concrete measures to make sure the bedbugs went away for good other than removing the nest yes a nest from the room,1
even more concerning i think they mightve put people in that room after i left not sure though,0
in any case the place is run like a factory,0
good hostel walking tour was great,0
always good to do,0
didnt have long there,0
so not got much to say,0
ok if you dont mind lots of noise as the bar downstairs is loud for ages but then again there is a bar downstairs,0
good beds and very clean but more of a hotel feeling instead of a hostel feeling ,1
staff ended breakfast at exactly 11 even if it was 1102 and they still had croissants leftover ,0
a little outside of the town but easy to get around with the metro download the metro app it is very helpful ,0
the only pro of this hostel is the location and the nearby restaurants and attractions ,0
besides that we had a bad stay,0
we booked a private room which is on the fifth floor and there are no elevators worst part though was on our last night they woke us up at 2am and told us to leave,0
the next guests came 12 hours early and the manager kicked us out and moved us to dirty beds at 2am and only gave us a 50 refund for the night although they later gave us a full refund for the night,1
great atmosphere,0
here you can easily socialize with different types of people depending on your preference,0
the best part of this hostel  clean restroom,1
cheers to your great staff,0
terribly hot,0
like stay in hell,0
great place to stay awesome bar and meeting place rooms good and clean staff very good and helpfull,1
really nice hostel,0
very clean,1
very secure,0
not much of a community vibe though,0
unfortunately we were there in summer and they have no airconditioning or fans so it was very hot in the rooms,0
the shared bathrooms werent particularly clean,1
the hostel seemed like a pretty good value,0
the staff were super friendly and helpful and the guests were all respectful,0
the downsides were the lack of a hasp to lock up your belongings below the bed there was only a small cubby hole by your head in the sleeping pod with a hasp,0
the pods themselves were unfinished plywood,0
 im not sure if that was the intent,0
hit,0
it seemed a little unfinished,0
the rest of the amenities were excellent and the area and location were excellent as well,0
my family had a great time at godos place,0
i have a family of five with three young children 8 10 and 15 years old,0
it was great have a private space in a guest house with a shower and a kitchen ,0
my children loved the garden with grapes fish and frogs,0
in addition godo and his girl friend paquita is a super host,0
they invited me to a bbq,0
we had a pleasant conversation about politics and culture,0
thank you godo,0
the good clean facilities and comfortable rooms,1
great coffee shop downstairs often frequented by locals ,0
the bad boring hostel with virtually no social events available,0
great hostel,0
if i would like to go ahain i would stay in here,0
rooms hot,0
filthy bathrooms,1
one toilet between 5 rooms which was broken and the sink didnt drain,1
worst hostel ive stayed in in 4 months,0
stay away,0
would not go back,0
awesome hostel to start my europe trip,0
cleanest hostel ive ever seen and the privacy curtains on the beds made you feel like you were in a private room,1
air conditioning was great too,0
the rooftop was a great social place to meet people but only in the evening as its too hot during the day,0
its not in the nicest area of town,0
so i didnt walk around alone at night,0
but its really close to the metro that makes it super easy to get to where you need to go,0
the room was spacious and the bed was fine but it was so hot in london during my stay that i was pretty miserable,0
this isnt the hostels fault as that kind of weather is pretty rare but something to keep in mind,0
they did provide a fan on my second night but this didnt do much to help,0
the bathroom was a bit dingy but served its purpose,1
i went down near the end of breakfast and no staff were there but i did manage to make myself a bowl of cereal,0
perfect place to base yourself in hostel if youre looking for a fun sociable party vibe,0
great common room with couches tables kitchen etc where everyone hangs out and enjoys during their stay,0
very easy to meet people and find some accomplices for a night out or otherwise,0
staff are chilla helpful and kind,0
they seem to be keeping facilities updated and fresh,1
only suggestion is to ensure guests are making their beds lots of ppl sleeping without which is a bit iffy,1
love this place,0
first floor was super loud during the night,0
great experience overall,0
laundry was pretty meh and expensive,0
great vending machines,0
xoxo,0
while the hostel was absolutely excellent in every regard the wifi went down for the last day and while thats not the staffs fault they were incredibly rude about it and,0
i asked if i could get a partial refund seeing as wifi was part of the reason i booked the hostel and i was talked down to that free service does not get refunds and i tried to explain my position that it wasnt free but included in the price and was insulted further,0
i want the refund,0
nice place great library bar,0
just one minute from the subway station,0
ok place to state for a night,0
if youre in berlin stay at the heart of gold,0
i was initially put off by its location as not on jy line,0
but actually it works to its advantage  saw a newnicer area of tokyo and only 20 minutes from shinjukushibuya,0
easily accessible and private room for 2 nights in september  luxury  good space private balcony facilities better than a hotel,0
atmosphere good but also used as a cafe,0
separate lounge spaces on each floor very well catered,0
a bit pricey but good quality nonetheless,0
would definitely stay again,0
this place is a little pricey compared to others in london but worth it for a night or two,0
the staff was friendly and welcoming,0
we loved our stay,0
but if u are looking to just save money there are probably better options,0
reached the hostel before checkin time and the staff was kind enough to let me keep my bag there they have a room just for this which is very secure ,0
the location is 20 mins away from the eiffel tower,0
and 2 mins away from metro,0
the rooms and toilets are regularly cleaned,1
my room had ac which ensured a good night sleep given the heat,0
the bar is good too,0
had a blast there during the world cup ,0
this was the first time that i ever stayed in a hostel and 3 ducks was a great first,0
the place was super clean and my favorite part was the beds,1
they have the best pillows and blankets ever,0
they are right by the hongdae station maybe like a block away if that,0
100 will be staying here again when i come back to seoul â¤,0
ï¸,0
me cobraron demÃ¡s una noche en prÃ­vate room ,0
y al cuestionar porque me indicaron que se hizo mal la reserva,0
lo cual no es cierto,0
y,0
no buscaron ayudarme,0
awesome location staff are very happy to answer all questions,0
good food on site but perhaps a bit pricey compared to the other options around,0
the free walking tour of royal london was fantastic although i think a walking tour of the immediate area and where shops etc are situated would be a good idea,0
overall very much enjoyed my stay would stay again,0
this place has ac ,0
that was my biggest concern but luckily it was nice and cold in the room ,0
staff was friendly location was great price was good ,0
overall a great place to stay for a couple nights in paris,0
amazing value for money and great location,0
staff are super friendly and helpful,0
only real issue was the laundry machines  most of them were out of order when i was there,0
hopefully theyve fixed them now though ,0
front desk crew leaves a lot to be desired,0
theyre a bit rude especially if you forget the ever so covered door code,0
they want you to wear a wristband which is juvenile,0
the wifi doesnt work well in the rooms,0
the beds are comfortable and the hostel seems to draw some incredible people,0
all in all  not a bad place but not a great location and staff could be better,0
not a great hostel overall,0
firstly it is not unclean which is good but the room was small even by hostel standards and felt very dark and claustrophobic,1
location is okay south kensington is lovely but theres not much around,0
its about a 15 min walk to the tube fine in summer but in winter would be a nightmare,0
some of the staff were friendly some not,0
overall id say book somewhere else in london,0
its a great city and this hostel will not endear you to it in the slightest,0
you get what you pay for  ,0
there were quite a few rude employees,0
the laundry machines left soap on the clothing and we spent 3 hours trying to dry one load and we ended up having to hang dry our clothing ,0
the room and services when compared to other hostels not worth the additional cost ,0
the breakfast was good however not worth the price especially considering they would run out of cups and plates as well as coffee and not bother replace them,0
i didnt actually stay here,0
although my reservation was made months in advance there had been a water leak in the room i had reserved,0
the staff worked quickly to book me a premium room at generatorparis,0
however their staff gave excellent service through the process and i was very impressed,0
awesome place,0
very clean,1
very friendly staff and great to meet other travelers,0
pub blaring downstairs and busking musicians all playing until midnight  shower wasnt great either,0
not the most conveniently located and security was pretty lacking if one knew where to go you could get straight from outside to the rooms without needing any sort of key,0
that being said you get what you pay for and this was one of the cheapest places in london so i cant bash it too much,0
go here if you need to save a buck and just want a place to lie your head at night,0
you had better to sleep in a sleeping bag on a street,0
dont stay this place,0
whole reviews are lie,0
location great,0
people nice,0
clean,1
great hostel,0
nice location nice common area including a rooftop with a view of the skyline great staff ,0
great stay,0
amazing atmosphere in the bar and really close to everything,0
pierce was a legend,0
unfortunately i was a little disappointed,0
after reading reviews i expected more,0
although easy to access via public transport it was not as central as id hoped,0
there was also only 2 plugs in a 6 bed,0
id read that the breakfast was good value which i have to strongly disagree with although just â‚¬3 it was bread jam and a coffee,0
the atmosphere was quiet and when we returned in the evenings all lights were off not just rooms all lights,0
overall it was good value but lower expectations,0
rooms were very small for the 3 of us,0
felt like another bed had been added to a one bedroom room,0
the hostel is very well done the bathrooms are nice the shower is super practical the rooms are private with the little curtain and they have ac,0
the restaurant is good and not expensive,0
but the location is not safe specially at night peoples are weird and doesnt make you feel safe,0
i stayed in paris before near the canal and it was safe and nice even at night,0
otherwise the gare du nord is at 2 minutes walk witch is practical to go back at the airport,0
i spent muy last night here,0
the place has everything nerd showers rooms friedge good wifi,0
also as a foreigner the staff is very helpful and friendly  they speak in english so it is very helpful,0
very secure if you are carrying luggage ,0
the place also has good location with a quickmart in a side  in that street there are some markets and restaurants and very close and easy to move to the shinagawa station,0
i stayed in this hostel in early july and it was not a good experience,0
there were not enough showers and toilets to cope with the amount of guests and we had to wait 30 minutes or more to use them each time,0
the beds were really old and not very comfortable and the kitchen facilities were cramped and not built for more than two people to use at a time,0
the staff were reasonably friendly but i would not say that this was value for money as it is also quite a train journey in to the city,0
amazing location and amazing host,0
enrico was the most helpful and sweet hostel owner,0
and the turkish market on the next street has great food,0
the hostel is a little rough around the edges,0
so if youre more in to perfectly presented spaces its probably not for you,0
but we found it charming it was cheap and comfortable so certainly did the job and the location and enrico were worth every penny,0
good view inside  good atmosphere,0
had a fantastic time here,0
the common room was great for meeting all sorts of people as was the outside area,0
friendly staff good washing service and comfortable rooms no frills but still excellent and clean,0
great hostel with lots of cool places in the area,0
staff is very friendly and hosts events,0
rooftop has beautiful views of the city,0
very clean and well equipped,1
my only complaint is sometimes the front desk can be slow and the location is a bit far from everything,0
the events they hold downstairs at the bar area were a lot,0
of fun and a great way to meet people,0
masa  the man the myth the legend,0
if you want to know what to eat in nishiarai  hit this guy up,0
generally everything was great,0
the staff people,0
the location is not that bad either,0
youll get around super easy,0
just make sure to ask about a 900Â¥ ticket,0
i will definitely come back one day,0
we stayed at meininger berlin east side gallery to do just that see the gallery,0
bonus was that the hostel was located walking distance to friedrichshainkreuzberg bourough plenty of beach bars and a quick train trip into the major tourist attractions,0
hostel room was clean the only downfall was that the lockers were not large enough to store our bags  there were no keys to open them,1
the hostel its self felt very safe,0
the guy behind the bar was great,0
we would stay again,0
the staff at the hostel were very friendly however when showed to our room at around half 2 in the afternoon we found the lights off and people were sleeping,0
a very awkward position to be in,0
we turned around and got ready in the car,0
we returned to get some sleep at around 2am,0
very difficult as the pillow provided was really thin and uncomfortable,0
i ended up sleeping without my quilt and using that as a pillow,0
luckily enough the room was warm enough to do this,0
you yet what you pay for,0
while the desk staff was very kind and helpful and its only a 10 minute walk from victoria station there is not much food nearby and the bathrooms were quite dirty ,1
also the water is non potable strangely,0
toilets where disgusting not cleaned and the smell was horrendous,1
urine all over the floor ,1
the showers was on a timer and would stop after 1min,0
some even less,0
aswell as the lights turning off half way through the shower ,0
the rooms where surrounding the courtyard were the bar was located ,0
it was soo noisy for most of the night and couldnt sleep ,0
the location was good though and the room we had was good besides the noise,0
great place to stay when in tokyo,0
one of the best hostels i have stayed at,0
great location right by alexanderplatz made it super easy to get anywhere in berlin clean and modern but not the best atmosphere for solo travellers not really a backpacker hostel closer to a hotel with shared rooms,1
its pretty good facility generally but there are no elevator from reception office to rooms,0
so it was so hard to bring my bags to the upstairs ,0
the staff helped me bring it,0
but i am sorry that its not useful  ,0
but great view and the other things is nice ,0
thank you,0
cant rate this hostel highly enough everything i want from a hostel and more,0
great staff great bar great facilities and rooms great large beds with curtains charging and locker built in,0
only downer was its 15 minutes walk to train station but its still walking distance to shibuya so cant complain much ,0
favourite hostel ive ever stayed in,0
i wouldnt recommend this hostel to anyone,0
very overpriced very very small rooms 4 bed dorms are absolutely not big enough for 4 people visibly dirty,1
woke up covered in bed bug bites however i have received a full refund for my stay,1
strange atmosphere,0
location wasnt bad,0
but i am sure you could find better,0
probably the worst hostel i have stayed in,0
the photos do not add up to what youre actually staying in,0
staff were very helpful and the security was excellent,0
the room was very small with not a lot of space for luggage,0
would stay again for a night or two but not long term,0
awesome hostel,0
amazing views and a really lovely atmosphere,0
staff are super friendly and helpful,0
it feels like you are staying at a friends place,0
which isnt bad but can be a little offputting,0
overall i would stay here again,0
clarence park is a nice hostel that is convenient in location to everything in toronto,0
it has a great homey feel that you will most likely not get anywhere else in toronto,0
the staff and residents were extremely friendly and always felt approachable,0
a couple small issues such as the ac not working half the time and was not fixed when asked multiple times bathroom not being attached to inside of the room and a few other minor issues,0
overall a great stay and we would love to come back again,0
i was flying from canada to japan,0
i thought i booked the right date but because of the time change i arrived a day later than intended,0
upon arrival i was told that i was going to be charged 50 dollars for the missed day and another 50 for the only room that was available,0
when i asked them to give me a break they told be they had no control,0
and i should contact hostel world,0
when i did i was refunded my deposit but would need to contact the hostel for the rest of it,0
i feel cheated and lied to,0
the hostel itself is really nice and there are great people,0
so its worth staying if youre a backpacker,0
the beds are not the best bit swinging and the mattresses are very thin,0
however the great wall tour is amazing  special and lone part of the wall bit challenging but totally worth it and also a very good lunch at the end is included,0
conveniently located next to gare du nord,0
the neighbourhood isnt great,0
but its conveniently located to montmartre and the centre,0
food in the restaurant was good and bathrooms and beds were clean and private,1
i really liked two peas it was nice and friendly and the facilities were really nice,0
the location was good not perfect but still very convenient,0
overall a really good stay,0
the key flaws in this hostel were down to the fact it says hostel in the title and not hotel as in there was a lack of atmosphere and the staff seemed a bit confused by us wanting to use their cooking facilities which were literally just a microwave and nothing else,0
the hostel was ok,0
the location was amazing but it would have been cool to know how close things were,0
the atmosphere was soso as people didnt really talk to each other unless you were outside and you have to come in around 11 as to not wake the neighbours,0
if your on a budget good place to stay but if you can spare the extra i recommend you do it,0
the opera hostel is so good nice rooms but left connections for charge phone near the bed,0
the garden is amazing for drink and eat something with friends and relax,0
the breakfast is amazing a lot of foods and many kind and all you can eat i loved this hostel and i advice for everyone i hope come back someday,0
this was my first time staying in a hostel and i loved it,0
we were able to stock up on a big breakfast and were located a short walk from the train station,0
the rooms were clean and you were able to put your valuables away in a locker,1
i stayed in a room with 8 people and we shared a shower and toilet,0
we all became friends and went out together on our last night,0
stayed one night,0
staff super nice but no free breakfast,0
room was a little dirty and the inside looks very old,1
overall pretty good stay,0
firstly,0
this hostel is huge so be prepared to wait in line 45 mins to check in,0
i feel like theyre understaffed in reception,0
the bathrooms werent the cleanest they didnt even have hand soap,1
the cleaners woke me up every morning at 10am pretty much telling me to get out of bed which made my blood boil especially because i wasnt checking out,0
superb location walking distance to many theaters local attractions and underground stops,0
power sockets at every bed along with a light which is great,0
useful luggage storage for when you check out though its a shame that you cannot pay for late check out ,0
rooms are very warm but they do provide a fan that is already in the room for you,0
the bunk bed ladders are some of the worst ive ever experienced though i know it sounds ridiculous,0
but they were the most awkward ladders to get down,0
loved my stay here,0
booked two nights and extended with another two,0
the metro is fairly close,0
cool people at the hostel ,0
owners are just great,0
definitely recommend staying here,0
its not in the super busy part of town which i like cause you know delhi is pretty chaotic,0
good location staff were friendly rooms had everything you need but nothing more  its what i expected from a hostel that costs a bit â‚¬30â‚¬40 but not worth â‚¬70 for a night and then another â‚¬90 for an extra night was definitely not worth it,0
 perhaps one of the best hostels in the world,0
very good hostel good facilities,0
nice calm hostel,0
their towel shipment didnt arrive the day i stayed there,0
they said my towel would come eventually but i never received a towel,0
i asked if i could purchase one to which the front desk clerk shrugged and said i could try to buy one at gar du nord,0
i said forget it and that i would drip dry,0
when the receptionist the next day asked how my stay was i mentioned the towel thing and she offered her apologies and then gave me 2 free breakfast vouchers,0
i was checking out that day,0
so i did not use it,0
staff,0
greathelpful and knowledgable ,0
i travelled alone and met many new friends,0
bar is small but fun,0
i would recommend a 12 bed room or less just for comfort and bathrooms are bigger imo short or long your stay will be fun,0
ultimately leo hostel is an amazing place to stay,0
it is in a great location friendly staff who speak decent english they have great trips you can book with them and really cheap beer ,0
the only issue is that our ac broke in our room and it was unbearably hot and could not sleep,0
we asked them multiple times to fix it and they did nothing about it,0
ac is a deal breaker for beijing in the summer time,0
i hope they would be more attentive to those types of things in the future,0
only stayed night as i had an early flight from tegel airport in the morning  was the perfect location for this,0
however i cant rate the location properly otherwise,0
if anything i would say that the area felt a bit dodgy ,0
staff allowed me to check in late which was great,0
secure with key card access to rooms ,0
clean in the rooms and bathrooms ,1
overall good value for money,0
the boat was kind of quirky,0
but we really enjoyed it,0
really close to restaurants and public transport ,0
the rooms are a little tight but we spent most of our day exploring or on the deck,0
so we didnt mind,0
awesome hostel good value for the money good location,0
it could do with more power plugs but i think its just people are using more electronics these days,0
the hostel has an excellent location with a jr station just outside,0
in fact i stayed here twice,0
each bed has 2 power outlets and two usb ports to charge electronics,0
it also includes a safe to keep valuables,0
the bags are conveniently stored in the big space below the beds,0
theres also a tatami floor in the room,0
hachi the owl is really cute greeting travelers in the reception,0
the common area has 2 pcs and theres place to enjoy the food bought in the konbini from across the street,0
dont stay here at summer time ,0
this was the worst experience that ive ever had ,0
i went to many others generators before,0
but i never felt so disrespected in my entire life ,0
im traveling with my mom which is nearly 60 they put us on the 4 floor but the lift wasnt working for two days but that not the worst the bedroom tells more like a sauna that a room when i asked for help they gave us only one fan  the smallest type that you can imagine  ,0
so we stayed 2 days but couldnt enjoy,0
great location really spacious rooms clean but security was poor as found someone sleeping in my bed as mostly reception gives you a room key usually without checking your name,1
really enjoyed it,0
i got involved in the workshops that they offered,0
i did a free walking tour to a temple as well as,0
a wagashi traditional japanese sweets workshop which was an amazing experience,0
i also rented the bikes they had which was really affordable and a great way to travel tokyo,0
would stay again,0
tbh wasnt good place for me hostel is on the 4th floor of building without elevator ,0
so when u check inout u have to go up and down ur self with ur stuffs ,0
and receptions not really stay at hostel dont know why ,0
so when u need some info u cant ask to receptions at hostel they have only 2 small toilets ac is not really work location is main street in hongdae area ,0
but thats kinda problem ,0
bc they have street performance every time ,0
so always really noisy,0
clean room friendly helpful staff and a good atmosphere,1
definitely recommend and stay again,0
great hostel with great people,0
okay hostel  serves its purpose,0
good location but quite difficult to find,0
showers okay  quite clean ,1
big rooms but beds are super uncomfortable but worth it for the location which is smashing  5 min stroll from bars restaurants metro and a short taxi to the bus terminal,0
super cool ambience at this backpacker hostel,0
it was such a rare find specially having spent last 4 months in india and after staying at so many hostels the hosteller delhi definitely deserves 10 on 10 for every reason,0
clean comfortable good vibes good food and wonderful interiors,1
their events like movie nights and pub crawls are so fun seems like the night never ends in the hosteller ,0
great all round,0
we had the best time,0
its a hostel and looks and feels like one also quite noisy but the private room was the best we had in india and we had the best time and met great people,0
awesome location with a great common area right in the centre,0
great kitchen facilities and really social,0
would recommend,0
the hostel was fairly quiet  possibly due to its location,0
unfortunately the bathroom and bedroom floors had not been cleaned prior to our arrival,1
we politely requested that the bathroom be cleaned which to our disappointment was not done throughout our stay,1
besides this the beds were clean and the staff were very helpful,1
loved the stay at eastseven,0
might just be my new favorite hostel,0
i was suffering some kind of migraine and feeling extremely dizzy and sick and the staff were helpful enough to get a big icepack from the bar that i could put on my head and later a plastic bag of ice cubes,0
i would have called an ambulance if not for them so appreciate it very much,0
and they adapted well to a situation they seemingly hadnt encountered before,0
id say this is one of the better hostels in the paris,0
its near pigalle a happening neighbourhood and reasonably priced,0
bathrooms and rooms are reasonably clean albeit a little small,1
the staff was friendly,0
its not really a partysocializing place and there werent many activities to meet other travellers,0
the hostel is really cheap and good value for money,0
but 2 things i did not like at all lockers in the room have wierd locking system so that noone uses them maybe when you buy a pedlock at the reception it may work but me and all my room mates couldnt find the way how to lock it so that our belongings would be kept on a safe place,0
to sleep with valuable things under the pillow is just not cool,0
the cleanliness of showers and toilets was awful,1
but staff was very nice esp,0
danielle ,0
thx,0
good location and nice staff,0
not the cleanest place ive ever stayed,1
the bed wasnt that comfortable and there wasnt enough space to put the luggages,0
the atmosphere wasnt that great either,0
i stayed in three other hostels  guesthouses in tokyo that were much nicer,0
considering the cheap price this one is good value for money,0
the hostel is really well located in a nice 7 store building,0
the last floor is the bar with a terrace which has a nice view of the city,0
the rooms have a good size with a lot of space and each bed had an outlet and a reading light which is really helpful,0
besides that the bathroom is inside the bedroom,0
really good and clean,1
the only negative point is that i stayed on the first floor which can be really loud at early hours but an earplug solved the problem,0
totally recommended,0
we only stayed for one night as we were passing through to kyrgyzstan,0
however we had a great time and the staff were really helpful,0
you are only a small walk from the bazar ,0
note if you take the metro turn right and walk until you come to a set of traffic lights big intersection,0
here you will go left over a bridge over railway,0
keep to the right as you will see a set of stairs that go down to the road,0
turn right and then the hostels street is not far up on your left,0
honestly such a lovely trip,0
at first the place seems too big and that hostel vibe might be forfitted but if you involve yourself in the activities run daily like the pub crawl youll meet so many people,0
really great trip and good area pools so shallow though but still fun,0
astor victoria was a great place to stay with very nice helpful staff,0
the breakfast is incredible too,0
although they do not have a free breakfast it only costs one pound so it is a great deal and will save you a lot of money,0
the rooms are clean and you get your own compartment to store your belongings,1
i would definitely recommend this hostel if you are okay walking a good amount,0
pretty much a standard hostel,0
the room was kinda small we had a 4 bedroom,0
the communal showers were clean so there wasnt an issue with that and our room itself was clean,1
only like a 10 minute walk from kings cross too,0
my experience was bad in this hostel with staff as i called one of my friend from outside the hostel to my room for some time,0
after that i got an email from reception saying its against the hostel policy to call guests on the room,0
i checked all the terms and conditions after that but didnt find anything like this,0
i replied to them saying that this is not mentioned in the tc rules but still they were rude and denying this,0
also after 12 pm you cant go out as all the doors get locked,0
lovely hostel the picture online do not do it any justice,0
we had a private room which as great because there was loads of room big kitchen and sofa to you to use,0
the bar next door where you can get discounted food and drinks is great and really cheap and the food is good,0
very clean,1
and you get given towels,0
the hostel is in a good location and the place looks nice when you enter almost hotel like but when i entered my room it wasnt what i expected,0
there were barely any plugs for a room of 12 people and only 2 small bathrooms which was not ideal,0
my backpack also didnt fit in the locker which was odd because i did not have an overly large backpack and i was uncomfortable leaving it on my bed,0
so i had to use luggage storage instead a little inconvenient,0
i enjoyed my stay at this hostel,0
i found the staff to be friendly,0
the hostel in a grate location,0
room was nice and bed was comfortable to sleep in ,0
will definitely be staying there again,0
wish they leave the drinking water out all night but really enjoy my time there,0
great but no air conditioned,0
and they put a windows that only does open 5cms,0
it was a decent place to stay id stay again,0
staff were nice ,0
pros 1,0
close to eurostar train and underground metro convenient 2,0
every bed have a light switch attached to headboard and includes both usb and outlet charging station ,0
cons ,0
1,0
the showers at this place isnt scorching hot enough for me  ,0
2,0
no ac so windows must be left open or itll be horridly stuffy with 10 people inside,0
when the windows are open the outside carstrucks are very loud so put earplugs on ,0
rooms smell of sweat and bo,1
i dont think they do enough washing of the mattress pads and the female above me wasnt even using her sheets to sleep on which was extremely gross,1
common area closes at 130am,0
which is bizarre since all other hostels are open 24hrs and no food in rooms,0
one of the staff notified me at 130 that kitchen was closed as soon as i finished making my meal i asked where i could finish it,0
and he said not in the hostel,0
i had to finish my food on the curb outside,0
the showers could do with a bench to stop belongings from getting soaked,0
the room was extremely hot and stuffy and bathroom lacked power sockets,0
super friendly staff and sociable patrons  really easy to make friends in the downstairs bar which doubles as the lounge,0
the showers are a bit old and the upper level rooms were incredibly hot during the summer making it hard to sleep at night,0
the staff were so friendly and helpful,0
my only complaint is that the hostel is located down a narrow alley that makes it difficult to find at first and extremely creepy to walk down at night,0
a comfortable spot to bunker down for a few nights if needed,0
very close to kings cross station busses and the underground,0
the room had 2 bunk beds in that were so close to one another you could only just get through,0
the only space you have to sort stuff from your bag is the where your feet are as you step into the room,0
locket is big enough,0
bathroom is basic,0
one of our favourite hostels,0
the bar is a good place to meet people with a happy hour 89pm where beers are â‚¬1,0
also theres a italian restaurant around the corner that does good takeaway pizzas,0
in the hostel the rooms are spacious and theres six bathrooms with showers on each floor 3 womens 3 mens,0
so theres nearly always at least one free,0
only let down is the nearest supermarkets quite far away,0
but its fine if you dont mind walking,0
the hostel is located in a quiet and nice neighborhood the building and facilities are well preserved with excellent conditions ,0
upon our arrival the friendly staff helped with the whereabouts and directions to the nicest places in london,0
it only takes a nice 5 minutes walk to the tube or one of 3 free museums around ,0
manuel and rui were very kind throughout our stay,0
 ,0
i highly recommend this place we will come back for sure,0
great location very friendly staff a decent bar on the first floor ,0
close to the subway and small grocery store across the street,0
overall fine doesnt have much atmosphere especially as a solo traveller,0
rooms were hot and little squishy,0
excellent place ,0
i would return ,0
all the desk workers were wonderful and the guests were very nice too ,0
the cleaning crew was also nice to everyone ,0
bar tenders were nice ,0
great experience ,0
we had one traveler in our dorm that would turn on the light every time he felt the urge ,0
disrespectful of all the rest of us ,0
dont know how the generator could change this guys behavior ,0
dont blame any one but him,0
it was a beautiful location but not very close to the center of town,0
i found this difficult because i had the hardest time navigating the metro system in france,0
there is a cool bar downstairs and a good free breakfast in the morning,0
my room did not have enough lockers for the number of beds,0
really nice and comfortable hostel,0
extremely clean great facilities friendly and helpful staff,1
in a good location with easy public transport connections to the main sites although these are also easily accessible on foot,0
rooms were really clean with own light plug sockets and large locker for each bed,1
hostel bar and cafe were great options but it was also fun to grab a beer from the shop and socialise outside,0
great hostel,0
a very nice place close to ikebukuro station,0
it was affordable clean and had very nice staff,1
the facilities were clean and were enough for the 10 bed dorms,1
the cafÃ¨ that turned into a bar evening was a nice addition as well,0
location really close to metro and two major train stations,0
some are saying its sketchy,0
i had no problems though i did see girls being catcalled a few times ,0
the hostel was fantastic in every respect security lockers cleanliness except for the fact that its too hot at night,1
cant open the window more than an inch,0
we had to open the hallway door to get some cool air into the room ,0
noise wasnt an issue but we were on the 5th floor,0
request a higher floor if youre worried about noise,0
had a great time,0
pints very cheap  had sky sports,0
atmosphere is brilliant  the irish girl at the bar is a great laugh,0
will be back for sure,0
amazing place and brilliant staff,0
great location,0
could do with air conditioning as it gets very warm at night,0
very comfortable rooms amazing service and help from max,0
local suburb is a short train ride from city offering a cosy and friendly local environment,0
would recommend,0
amazing place,0
100 recommended,0
staff are friendly and helpful to everything you need,0
burgers are amazing,0
will stay here again,0
cheap bed no frills,0
have stayed in better and worse places throughout london,0
would consider staying here again next time im in london,0
perfect location ,0
it was a really great stay,0
they recommended some great places to visit and the location is perfect,0
good although it was really really hot in the bedrooms,0
the best part of the hostel the bathrooms,0
the showers are amazing and very clean,1
first hostel ive been to where you have to pay extra for bed linen,0
too many teenagers,0
pretty far out of the city centre,0
got upgraded to 4 bed room everything was pretty good at what was advertised,0
the location and staff are amazing the problem is that the hostel is not very clean and i had two nights where we had problems figuring out what beds were open because they dont clean the old beds and check the rooms before new people stay at the hostel,1
also there was so much old junk under the bed it was terrifying,1
the staff were very nice and helpful though which was nice,0
many restaurants in the neighbourhood,0
kitchen only open 8am  9pm,0
elevator out of order when i left with my luggage,0
the room was not to hot although it was a heatwave,0
near to the metro and easy access to both the airport bus x9 and haubtbahnhof,0
best hostel ive stayed at in beijing,0
super friendly and accommodating staff who treated me as a genuine friend rather than just a guest,0
the bedroom setup offered comfortable privacy and facilities were clean comfortable and new,1
only complaint is that the bathroom is outside but it was barely a nuisance,0
in the winter it may be a bigger deal,0
otherwise convenient location close to metro and very safe,0
right in an old hutong with a nice old beijing feel,0
phenomenal staff,0
the place is greatright downtown,0
only negative is the bar downstairs,0
toronto argos game was on tv,0
i asked the bartender twice to switch on the game even though the place was empty but he didnt care otherb than that good place,0
it was an amazing experience,0
truly loved it,0
everything was really good,0
overall a very cool place there was always something going on lovely atmosphere and fellow guests,0
the 4bed dorm was clean although not having a socket anywhere close to your bed was a bit of a pain,1
the toilet and showers had a weird smell and couldve been cleaner however there was nothing extraordinarily repelling,1
the staff member i met when checking out wasnt the nicest on earth,0
and i had some trouble understanding them,0
all in all i would recommend this place for a short city break,0
good communal area with lots of seating and a nice bar no cooking facilities and was far out of town but close to a station so takes 20 mins to get to the center,0
good lockers in the room and fairly quiet outside at night,0
grand hostel berlin is beautiful and more importantly very clean,0
the library bar downstairs is cozy and ideal for making new friends which is great because the staff doesnt get too hyped about the daily events such as the family dinner or german lessons,0
despite the lack of enthusiasm the staff is helpful and go above and beyond to assist you in figuring out the logistics of your stay,0
the hostel is new and the facilities are wellthought comfortable mattress small locker for valuables in the cabin lock to leave the suitcases in the common room,0
the bathroom is clean,1
i was afraid it would be loud because there is no door between the sleeping area and the entrance also the main common room but because there is nothing to do in the main room no kitchen area or bookshelves it was quiet,0
the hostel is just a dormitory a place to sleep perfect for me,0
staff very warm,0
i liked the hostel,0
you can take the metro directly from the airport to the stop near the hostel which is great,0
the walking directions they have are perfect,0
everyone is very friendly and the room is nice,0
the shower was hot ,0
i have two minor complaints the air conditioner wasnt working too well and the windows had no curtains,0
that made it difficult to sleep ,0
i really liked this place,0
the front desk was very accommodating with me leaving early the next day,0
i wish i had more time there,0
good hostel overall ,0
not much of a social atmosphere,0
everyone seems to stick to themselves ,0
kitchen is decent except lacks stovetop ,0
no fans or ac in dorms very hot on a summers eve 10 bed dorm,0
great place in paris,0
great location as it is an easy walk to the underground or to use the buses nearby along with tourist attractions,0
we were a group of 4 mid 20s backpacking around europe  enjoyed the hostel and bar,0
super nice workers,0
felt extremely safe entire time and loved we were able to leave our bags there after checkout to explore,0
only downfall is no ac in summer,0
our room was not street side and had no airflow,0
so we were sweating horribly all night,0
got fan for 2nd night,0
but its pretty small,0
decent hostel too big to really have a good atmosphere  feels more like a hotel,0
the location is good,0
very nice and welcome stuff clean,1
 the other gests are very friendly a great place to stay in tokyo ,0
and the domitory room was quiet,0
so we had good sleep ,0
there is a big bath,0
we enjoyed it that was great ,0
when i come to this area i definitely stay here,0
 good sized beds showers and toilets on each level early check in was available cafebar downstairs very clean  not very central probably 1015 min walk to nearest subwaytrain have to rent towels they dont provide them no storage areas in your room for luggage its stated that there is,1
but its an unrealistic space for 10 people to share,0
staff were super friendly,0
showers were really powerful but shot out and you have to have the curtain closed because the water goes everywhere,0
also have to turn them back on every 2 minutes when they go off automatically,0
have to pay for lockers in the rooms,0
atmosphere is good,0
beds were really clean,1
pros fantastic location especially compared to many other paris hostels great bar with nice courtyard solid free breakfast clean good ac cons crowded room and overall hostel layout a little difficult meeting other travellers not the best vibe,1
showers were small and muggy with only one per floor,0
great location and friendly fun staff,0
excellent central location with access to bikes trains busses etc,0
staff were either drunk or high or both,0
rooms were basic with a small locker that didnt work very well,0
bathroom was disgusting didnt want to use it but didnt have any choice,0
 showers were push button that lasts max 6 seconds and then the light would turn off because its movement activated but it cant see you in the shower,0
a girl i met was in a 10 mix room with 9 guys,0
everything was going great  the singing receptionist the room the kitchen the location the price  until i saw the shower,1
its just me i know but if it were my place id bleach the crap out of that shower or use clove oil and remove the mould in there top to bottom,1
again it was a great place to stay in ,0
super nice place easy to meet people and has a kitchen p easy to get around the city if you have a ubahn pass,0
it is centrally located,0
the staff is really helpful,0
if you miss the all you can have breakfast,0
you are missing something for sure,0
place is neat and clean,1
people are also good,0
very dirty,1
the beds were very bad,0
i was disappointed in this hostel especially after seeing all the great reviews,0
i got an email after checking out saying if we didnt have a good stay to email them directly instead of publishing a review here,0
i will not do that as others should know what i think,0
the staff didnt make me feel welcome,0
once i checked in i had a question the staff wanted to make me wait 30 mins before answering a question,0
extremely hot in the rooms  it was a big deal to get a fan,0
wouldnt recommend,0
the rooms are very comfortable and the bathrooms are perfect,0
nice and clean,1
the breakfast is very good and tasty,0
nothing to complain about,0
upon arrival late in the night i am told that the ac in my room does not work ,0
therefore watch out for booking 6bedroom in this hostel,0
considering it is 115 fahrenheit  45celsius in delhi you might wanna stay a place where you are certain you will have ac,0
dirty linnen black hairs everywhere in my bed along with old chewing gum,1
main door can only be opened from the reception  both when coming in and going out,0
this is on 4th floor hence it will be difficult to get out in case of fire,0
we had a quick stay here only 2 nights but we had a pretty good time,0
the barclub was a lot of fun,0
staff wasnt extremely helpful when recommending places to eat other than their restaurant downstairs,0
fooddrink was a bit pricey in comparison to other hostels ive stayed at,0
security was really great,0
bathrooms smelled like a sewer,1
overall a good stay but probably wouldnt go out of my way to stay again,0
lots of amenities,0
rooms were very clean and spacious,1
our room had two separate showers which was great,0
staff was beyond friendly and helpful,0
it is close to the tramtrain restaurants and has a nice all you can eat breakfast in the morning,0
locks on lockers are a weird shape so my lock didnt fit in it but it felt safe enough there,0
so i went without,0
there were quite a few families staying during our time,0
i also found it wasnt the most social of hostels despite its large size,0
gorgeous building spacious and well ventilated rooms afaic,0
recommended,0
stayed here just for two nights in a mixed dormitory,0
it was nice having a shared bathroom in the room and the curtains around each bed gave you that extra bit of privacy,0
the kitchen was well equipped and nice to eat in and there was lots of space to store your food,0
i found it a bit unsociable as the main common room was just like a living room with people watching the football so there was no opportunity to meet people or i wasnt told of any social activities available,0
the location made this hostel,0
it was right in the centre of the city with a train and tube station right near by so you could get anywhere,0
they also offered a pub crawl which was good and allowed you to meet people ,0
however the rooms in the hostel are extremely hot there is an option to rent a fan although this doesnt help much,0
the showers are communal with no curtains or private changing area,0
i would prefer to stay somewhere else if i visited berlin again,0
the place looked more like a hotel than a hostel,0
sure they had a rooftop bar and a kitchenbarclub downstairs,0
but there wasnt a real common area to just chill with people near your dorm,0
i guess i just wanted a different atmosphere,0
kitchen staff were lovely and so were the security,0
reception staff were nice enough but several just had the worst attitudes like not even acknowledging your existence after you greeted themopened the door for them,0
place was near heaps of shops solid outfit,0
the best hostel i have been in this trip,0
the bathrooms were big and clean the dorms are really spacious,0
the location is near downtown the staff is great,0
cleanness good atmosphere free coffee,1
i felt really comfortable in this hostel and i was sharing a 10 bedroom dorm,0
but it was really spacious,0
and we had big windows,0
so it was fresh,0
it also has a big and clean kitchen with free food rice and pasta and it was really good,1
it has a great value for one of the cheapest hostels in berlin,0
this hostel is really more of a hotel with dorm rooms it doesnt have that chilled out hostel vibe,0
ive become more accustomed to but it is clean,0
you are charged for towels and storing your bag at an expensive rate find one in town,0
some of the showers are communal but they have private options ,0
huge thanks to sandra who dealt with a difficult issue with someone in my dorm in the middle of the night professionally and sensitively,0
 i really appreciated it,0
this woman needs a promotion,0
nice room on the rooftop with a view of scare coeur,0
i found it was very expensive,0
but its paris after all,0
the location itself was not the best belleville but it was 5 minutes away from the metro which i took everyday to get to the 17 arrondissements,0
the rooftop unfortunately closes at 10 pm so that sucks,0
clean room and nice bar downstairs,1
i just wish they would be more mindful of creepy drunk men from off the street coming into the bar ,0
what a great party i had there,0
really enoyed deals and live music,0
met nice people and staff was great,0
very nice atmosphere,0
beds were pretty comfy and the ac in the rooms was so clutch,0
the staff were all super nice and helpful,0
the bar is definitely a more local spot but was still enjoyable,0
didnt meet too many people,0
but i was also there on a tuesday night,0
this is the best location for visiting tokyo,0
just one station from harajuku but it feels like a world away in its quiet neighborhood,0
its easy to go from here to all the major areas of tokyo,0
also the staff were very kind and helpful and good at making coffee,0
the air conditioning was also excellent important for the hot months,0
100 recommendation this hostel,0
holeleak in the ceiling of room c meaning at least 2 beds are completely unusable,0
only one toilet in a room of 16 invariably led to a an unpleasent smell through the door into the toiletshower area,1
showerheads not attached to the wall ,0
staff were friendly and did put a sign up on the second day of my stay to offer a room change due to the ceiling,0
free breakfast was good,0
location ideal,0
good value for only Â£12 per night,0
the hostel had a great bar area which was sociable when you wanted to be,0
i stayed in two rooms and the first 4 bed dorm was tiny without a mirror or any space for your bags however the second had much more room and a mirror,0
it is not on a jr line but easy to walk to from a jr station,0
would recommend for all types of travellers,0
it is in a really convenient location and the place is really quite,0
the staff were very very nice but a bit of a walk to the train station to get to central berlin,0
there was a really nice park next to the hostel however which we chilled in quite often,0
great hostel in a good location,0
close to tube stations to get all around london,0
primary complaint is the temperature in the room,0
way too hot,0
the security was great and each bed had its own security locker,0
great place good location close to the river,0
 rooms are very stuffy with no airflow even with windows open needs fans or even better aircon other then that it was good,0
it was a nice clean hostel only a short walk from the moulin rouge and sacre coeur,1
at night it changes alot pigalles red light district is interesting to say the least we were offered the best pussy in paris on multiple occasions,0
the other main sights in paris were only accessible by metro unless you want to walk for a long time,0
overall a good hostel with a questionable location,0
stayed for a couple of nights to see one of my favourite bands,0
place was tidy the room had everything i needed they did a decent breakfast they are ideally located and no complaints at all ,1
they even sell trooper beer,0
ðŸ»ðŸ˜,0
i stayed here assuming there were comunal areas or more to do in montmartre,0
up the hill theres bougie wine bars and overpriced shops down the hill strip clubs and sex shops,0
a man followed me for 6 blocks soliciting sex unsafe,0
1st day in my tiny dorm a girl was switched to my room because a guy in hers was masturbating in front of her 0,0
space 0 privacy,0
booked 4 nights and left day 2 due to bedbug infestation,1
they gave me a partial refund,0
breakfast sucks but staff is cool,0
overpriced,0
atmosphere is fantastic the hostel is big and clean staff are so accommodating and helpful,1
socially its great too so good for solo travellers and metro stops are not too far away either,0
great location to base yourself and see all of london,0
such friendly staff,0
i loved the spaniard girl from the reception she was so nice and kind with us she helped us a lot and recommended us a lot of new places to visit in berlin,0
we felt very welcomed this hostel should be proud to have her in its staff ,0
ps the room was very nice and clean  ill definitely stay there if id go back to berlin ,1
loved this hostel so close to transport and pretty much on the doorstep of the east side gallery,0
the hostel had a pool but unfortunately it was being repaired when we stayed so didnt get to use it,0
our room was really cool and the hostel made an effort with decorations etc,0
dont really have any negatives other than the price was a little high in comparison to other places weve stayed but the staff and amenities made up for that,0
would stay again,0
was just stopping by for a night,0
but i extended to 3 because i enjoyed this place,0
delhi can be hot and hectic i found joeys to be quite a safe haven,0
met some really great people here including josh who will help you with any of your needs and some incredible philosophical insight,0
thanks again guys ,0
stayed at lazy fox den for 8 nights and am so glad i chose this hostel,0
the staff are incredible often joining the travellers in their touristic ventures as well as providing native korean help to directions booking taxis and general admin,0
they offer a laundry service for 3000w which was efficient and i found the other travellers really pleasant and look forward to seeing some of them again soon,0
would 100 recommend people of all ages and backgrounds,0
ill be back soon,0
website had told us 8 left in an 8 specific 8 bed dorm so we booked all 8 for seven of us,0
we arrive and they tell us we are split 4  4,0
i ask for a refund for 1 and fair enough they said no,0
however as we return from our nightout our booked bed in one of the rooms had been taken,0
due to there now being someone booked in our bed the next morning i asked for a refund and they declined even though they had booked someone in the bed,0
they knew we had seven and knew that bed was free,0
ðŸ‘ŽðŸ»,0
the staff are the least helpful people you will ever come across,0
arrived at 2 and queued for 30 mins for check in and got told it would be 20 mins until we could actually check in,0
went back after 20 mins queued again for 30 mins and got told it would be another 30 mins before the room was ready,0
queued again and it was finally ready went upstairs and realised it was dirty and had an awful smell,1
avoid this place,0
decent location close to bus stops and the ubahn turmstraÃŸe ,0
the hostel was very clean and the staff were friendly and helpful,1
it was particularly hot when i stayed and they let me keep my insulin in their fridge  ,0
the hostel is quite secure you even need your key card to get up the stairs to the rooms and to enter the bedrooms themselves do dont forget it,0
we really enjoyed our stay at generator  paris,0
so much so that we decided to cancel our next booking in amsterdam and change to the generator  amsterdam hostel,0
great place great people good food and atmosphere,0
we really enjoyed our stay and would return for another visit,0
highly recommended,0
fantastic place to stay,0
its not right in the middle of downtown tokyo,0
but its super easy to get to and from,0
theres lots of places to eat and shop around and they have a restaurant in house if you dont want to leave,0
very big hostel with a lot of organized groups,0
however the bar is fun the staff always friendly and there are a lot of common areas so you meet people,0
good for solo travelers,0
the location was comfortable and central but maybe too much into the nightlife,0
gorgeous hostel with delicious breakfast comfy beds great staff,0
the pool and sauna were an amazing addition and its close to some great nightclubs berghain,0
stay here,0
great place to stay clean comfortable and updated,1
reception staff very helpful friendlyfacitily great clean great kitchen and barwould recommend to others ,1
train about 6 blocks away but easy to find,0
would not recommend,0
the hostel cleanliness overall was average as there were stains on bedsheets ect,1
the staff were very rude and very unhelpful,0
very unorganised and didnt care the room i was supposed to stay in was fully occupied after the checkout time so my bed wasnt available,0
when i asked the reception about it the staff member on didnt seem to care and didnt know if they were supposed to be checking out or not and got angry at me over it,0
not coming back,0
only stayed for one night but the staff was super welcoming ordered us food and a cab and the other people there were super friendly as well,0
really nice rooftop and decent facilities,0
comfortable bed the roomwas clean,1
a very large hostel overalls pretty good  would stay again,0
okay atmosphere but absolute full of australians ,0
well at least thats what it appears to be as they where the only ones keen to socialise,0
the atmosphere in palmers lodge hillspring is really cool,0
the people working there are from all over the world and really friendly,0
i have met a lot of cool people in this hostel and i really loved the beautiful neighbourhood which is more quiet than the crowded city centre,0
but it still has its own fresh vibes,0
it takes some time to get to the city centre but if you like to experience the london underground then there should be no problem with that,0
the rooms were okay though the staff was rather rude so the entree was not totally to cheer for,0
especially after youve walked such a long way to get there note we could have taken the bus but we are poor poor students,0
also there was some creepy dude stalking around for hours outside the hostel whom we could see from our window so we were pretty creeped out by that,0
beautiful location  inside a huge park a gated compound close to the underground entrance,0
the park is very peaceful lots of activities going on inside,0
the staff are very friendly ,0
my partner and i booked together but got placed in separate rooms which was frustrating,0
the rooms are very small lots of beds crammed together three bunks high,0
i appreciate the curtains around each bunk for sure,0
the rooms were very loud very difficult to sleep,0
you can hear rooms around you making noise,0
its okay for late one night stay,0
small cramped room dirty not equipped,1
i stayed here for the price 33 pubs a night,0
but after 4 nights i think it should be cheaper 2025 pounds ,0
positives location is central staff are super friendly and helpful,0
the other hoteliers are friendly too,0
the pods are self contained and private negatives,0
the pillows are rubbish you can easily hear the club below which is noisy till 12am,0
people will be noisy coming and going at all hours and some are not considerate at all,0
leaving room lights on and making a lot of noise,0
really impressed with this hostel,0
needed somewhere to stay in between moving house whilst working long hours in a bar and this place was perfect,0
curtains on the bed and really comfy beds plus free ear plugs meant that i could sleep late into the morning and not be disturbed after my shift,0
everything super clean staff cannot do enough for you and facilities on point,1
ideal location for night tube into central,0
got my moneys worth,0
staff was very helpful and kept the place very secure ,0
the only issue was the bathrooms were not the cleanest and always smelled bad ,1
but overall i had a very great experience and the location was awesome,0
close to london bridge tube stations and borough market,0
stayed in the big mixed dorm and rooms were great but room and enough space between each bed,0
having the curtain there for privacy was also awesome and something other hostels should do,0
bathrooms were cleaned like 3 times a day and showers were big,1
staff helpful and awesome common room,0
only let down was location although close to a train station and food it was about 20mins on the train to get into the main attractions,0
would definitely stay again,0
perfect for a one night crash to ensure you make your flight on time the following day,0
food available right downstairs at the restaurant or 23 train stops away for more variety,0
train station down the street and around the corner,0
friendly cops that wont shoot you right on the corner to give you directions,0
hostel was super clean and quiet,1
not a social atmosphere but the beds were spacious and soft,0
i will definitely stay here again the eve of my flight out of tokyo,0
super close to paddington station which is really convenient,0
good staff who are helpful and friendly ,0
because its so close to a busy area its noisy,0
but thats to be expected,0
the beds are not great and the bathrooms are a bit moldy and not in the best shape,1
there are also no shelves for top bunks or personal lighting so that you dont disturb other people in your room if you come in a bit late,0
overall its not the best hostel but not the worst either,0
nice location nice vibe nice accommodation decent facilities i cant complain,0
overall a good experience ,0
the bathrooms and showers are dirty there was no liquid soap to wash your hands at any time,1
in the room i couldnt charge my mobile because all the usb adapters didnt work,0
the wifi connection doesnt work in the rooms,0
in the rooms is very hot in the summer and have no fans,0
i had to sleep on open windows on the ground floor and people passing by on the street could see the whole interior of the room,0
on the other hand the location of the hostel is great and the staff are wonderful,0
the staff and location were amazing,0
very close to the tube and many tourist attractions,0
however security was not great,0
you had a keycard to get into your room but beyond that the locks on the lockers were mostly broken or would still open with a padlock in them,0
and it felt more like a large hotel than a hostel not very social,0
and the bathrooms are tiny,0
this was my first experience at a generator hostel,0
i was expecting a great experience as my dil and son have traveled extensively and raved about the dublin and paris locations,0
it was filthy in the common areas,1
windows facing the smoking patio made our room reak of cigarettes,1
perhaps inform guests,0
the bathrooms smelled of sewage,1
so bad we had to use wc on other floor,
obviously the generator name does not equate to universal excellent lodging do your research,0
never again in london,0
this hostel was fine for a one night stay,0
the room was cramped and even though we had our own bathroom it was very small and the toilet water ran continuously,0
the bed was comfortable,0
the staff were efficient but not very helpful or welcoming,0
the hostel is located close to underground stations which is very convenient for getting around london,0
it didnt feel like the staff cared much particularly when it came to general upkeep shower was almost always covered in hair ,1
feel of the hostel was rather cold probably as it is part of a chain and so there wasnt a need to make it feel more personal ,0
the food cost a lot considering the audience is a bunch of studentsbackpackers and i dont think the no outside food policy is fair ,0
finally there wasnt much in place to help people mingle making it isolating,0
wasnt worth the cost,0
great hostel to stay at it has more of a hotel feel to it,0
as a solo traveller it was a bit hard to meet people because of the limited common areas lots of groups when i was there,0
the dorms and ensuite bathrooms are one of the cleanest i have seen in a hostel very very clean  shower gel and hair dryer included,1
staff were friendly and helpful,0
i would definitely come back here,0
oh and theres free apples at the reception ,0
a great place for our first stay in berlin,0
the staff were friendly and helpful the ubahn was just around the corner and there are great bars restaurants and shops on the doorstep,0
highly recommend,0
worst sleep ever,0
room looking onto main road and as there was no aircon fan but 35 degrees window had to be kept open all night so incredibly noisy  and still very hot,0
bunk bed very wobbly too,0
kitchen was rather disgusting though better than nothingif you just need a roof over your head its ok but for anything more  go find someplace else,1
this hostel is near public transportation but not much resturant or anything around,0
literally after 800 pm you have no option to eat rather than the one and only burger king nearby ,0
its tottally a mess noisy and the public shower and toilets feels like what you see from prisons in the movies ,1
no facility around and the beds are not comfy and standard ,0
the staff are not behaving nice and the price i paid was 50 for a night in a 6 bedroom female dorm more expensive than anywhere else,0
we arrived late and was very tired,0
so we got to bed as the first thing although we were told,0
sleep easy was it a bit hard bc of the club going on downstairs,0
a lot noisy,0
on the other side was the clubbar great,0
good location as it is just nearby the trainstation and metro on every corner if you would like to see paris,0
a lot of many other back packers so you cant avoid to get to know other people ,0
the cleanliss was okay,1
but we were told that it would be cleaned pr,1
2 day  it was not,0
had a great time in berlin,0
i just needed a clean spot to put my head for the night and this place fit the bill perfectly,1
and my bed was super comfy,0
and my roommates were totoally silent,0
very clean very accommodating staff,1
great place to stay in delhi,0
easy walk from the main train station,0
nice room friendly staff,0
plus berlin had a helpful and nice staff,0
the bed i stayed in was very comfortable but at night people were often loud in the courtyard,0
the neighborhood is known for being a hotspot for clubs,0
so i knew it would be a louder hostel and wasnt really bothered,0
they have a storage room you can keep your bags while you wait to check infor a flight,0
but they dont have a system to keep track of whose bags are who,0
i didnt run into any problems with any loss but it was something that concerned me,0
small hostel in a really nice neighbourhood,0
we had a private room and we did enjoy our stay,0
the only comment would be regarding the helpfullness of the staff,0
we went 3 times at the front desk to ask easy questions about berlin and the answer was always i dont know without even looking it up,0
i think the customer service should be improve ,0
great location,0
met some amazing people,0
helped make delhi a memorable experience for the right reasons,0
best hostel so far in india,0
a lot of solo travellers from all around the globe making it the best place to hang out and make your future travel plans,0
common kitchen is so huge you can literally spend the whole day cooking,0
overall perfect for people coming to delhi,0
best hostel experience ever will stay again,0
amazing location,0
pure class,0
the coolest part of town and and really nice vibe,0
i really cant complain its great value for your money and top central location you can reach good bars and all the great sights in walking distance,0
the only downgrades on the rating was that they didnt have locks left to rent so i got one at rewe remember to bring a lock with you for the locker,0
the second was the shower door was a little jammed,0
but im sure its already fixed great personel and service,0
i really liked that the dorms had their own bath facilities,0
overall i had a great experience,0
location is excellent clean and friendly staff,1
the only downside for me was that i book a private room with a private bathroom and the room they gave me did not have any windows,0
i felt like in a cage without knowing if it was hot or cold sunny or rainy ,0
great place,0
everything is new and the cleanliness is practically unbeatable,0
nice breakfast and awesome staff specially tamer who was really helpful the whole time and gave me very good recommendations about cairo and things to do in the city,0
i will definitely stay here again if i come back to cairo,0
we had a really great stay here,0
its a good location and near the metro,0
so its easy to get to a lot of key sights,0
the owner of the hostel is friendly and really helpful,0
he went out of his way to help us out with booking onward bus tickets and finding veggie food,0
not only that the place is spotless,1
very clean,1
we would definitely stay again ,0
friendly staff,0
facilities are dated but the value made it a fair tradeoff,0
positive points ,0
1 nice location easily reachable by public transportation ,0
2 spacious rooms 3 enough facilities showers and toilets 4 good breakfast value for money ,0
negative points 1,0
 lots of noise in the late evening as there is a bar gathering in front of the hostel and another one across the street plus the tram beeps ,0
2 rooms are not ready for summer no ac so you need to open the windows for some air to get in and hence noise  flies are unavoidable,0
such a great stay way better than saying in a hotel by yourself,0
other than the breakfast this hostel wasnt the greatest,0
had to open the windows as there was no ac and a lot of cigarette smoke from the streetsbar downstairs came into the room,0
we were also right above the pub so it was very noisy outside,0
the bathrooms were pretty disgusting,1
black mould in the shower cracks,1
and i saw a cockroach and mouse while in the washroom,1
the staff was very friendly though,0
really nice hostel with great staff,0
the only minus  rooms are quite small and crowded,0
but with good weather and few luggage no problem,0
the hostel is really well located 10 minutes walk from kings cross station,0
the staff was really nice and helpful,0
bar and restaurant at the front if you cant be bothered going elsewhere mostly western food choices though,0
beds are fine but no curtain and shared showers could use a little more cleaning,0
lockers are provided but bring your own lock,0
pretty decent for the cost,0
pretty decent,0
i stayed in the sixbeds room,0
the room size is decent and beds are okay,0
the weather was very hot during the time i stayed and there was a big fan in the room but the rooms temperature was very hot and humid,0
the toilet as well was smelly and not very clean,1
staff were helpful but not very friendly when i popped by the reception couple of times,0
overall it is an above average hostel and i would not mind staying there again if i am around the area and have no other options,0
pretty nice place,0
helps being close to the train staion,0
mostly friendly staff,0
nice modern and clean interior,1
the common area andgarden were good,0
the shower room needs ventilation,0
as soon as you were finished showering you were covered in sweat,0
also the wifi was basically non existent in our bedroom,0
i struggled with the size of the pillows and ended up using my small travel pillow instead,0
my minor complaint is that the bottom bunk have very little head room,0
and i couldnt even sit on the bed properly because of it,0
good location,0
i enjoyed the two days that i spent here,0
comfortable and clean,1
brunch was cheap compared to some other places ive stayed and the hostel is easy to get to anywhere you need to get to,0
staff was friendly and informative ,0
the bar downstairs was a little too young for me and the beer was interesting but there are other bars you can go to,0
in fact theres only public area with wifi very inconvenient,0
really nice hostel only negative was there were only two other guests,0
it was a little weird being one of only 3 people in a 5 story building,0
staff was friendly and chatted when they were there ,0
other than that it was nice and clean,1
i liked the rooftop lounge,0
there isnt much in the area immediately near the hostel but its very close to two major train lines which made it very easy to get places 15 minutes to insadong,0
also nice stream nearby to walk and night markets are walkable,0
loved my stay,0
clean cheap good location,1
i didnt find it terribly social however i also didnt go hang out in the communal area so that could be in large part why,0
would definitely stay again ,0
i loved my stay here,0
i found the location to be very strategic and not too bz and noisy,0
walking distance to tokyo subways,0
very clean bathrooms kitchen and room,1
quiet and nice place at a very strategic location with many restaurants convenient store and supermarket nearby,0
staff are very helpful too,0
totally recommended,0
best vibes best people best hostel ,0
decent hostel however wouldnt stay again,0
lobby smelled of cigarettes due to the security smoking right outside the door,1
mens bathroom only had 2 toilets and 2 showers for an entire floor and showers were on a 20 second timer so you constantly have to turn them back on,0
rooms are nice theres a curtain on the beds for more privacy a sink in every room and the wifi is really good,0
theres a door stop in the middle of the floor which seems hazardous,0
bar is great lots of food and drinks,0
great hostel incredible walking tours and great crew,0
i definitely would not hesitate to come here again,0
i was able to book a private room so my stay was quite enjoyable,0
the hostel is well situated and had all the usual facilities,0
i would stay again,0
amazing staff so helpful in so many ways ,0
great location,0
ideal position,0
great atmosphere about the place,0
would certainly stay here again,0
john,0
ðŸ˜€,0
everything was great and would reccommend to anyone,0
cool place to mingle and hangout  very good experiene,0
 location is great comfotable beds and felt safe,0
staff are very welcoming and friendly,0
always there to assist,0
i will stay at this lovely hostel again,0
when we first came to the hostel at about 1230 we were told we had to wait until 2pm to check in which we did,0
when we went into our rooms my bed was not made and the pillow smelled like sweat and there was an empty soda bottle on the bed,1
the rooms were unbearably hot we were on the top floor,0
i woke up at 6am to go downstairs to sleep because i was covered in sweat,0
my friend that i was traveling with got Â£250 cash stolen from her out of the bathrooms,0
great hostel clean and have everything,1
the staff is nice and friendly,0
i totally recommend this hostel,0
great hostel staff were super friendly  helpful ,0
room was spacious however ours was quite hot during the morningday as it was the top level  has floor to ceiling windows ,0
bathrooms were cleaned frequently  were fairly big ,1
great courtyard to hang out in  meet people cheap drinks during happy hour at the bar was great ,0
good location for public transport on the same block as the s bahn and metrotram ,0
would definitely recommend,0
a good place only there late at night and left early but good location and bags felt very safe,0
had a wonderful stay,0
hostel staff is really helpful and provided me with bed even before the check in time,0
dorms were nice and clean with ac,1
also loved the rooftop restaurant they serve the best chai,0
this was my very first hostel experience and i was welcomed by friendly staff and felt at home straight away,0
nice vibe and daily group activities and night activities as group dinner was all very nice ,0
shout out to johan leah mike greg rafael for amazing friendly help and will definitely come back next time,0
im in london,0
what we got for the price was great,0
their tour guide was super helpful and made our week there memorable with the golden triangle tour he suggested,0
just two things i wasnt too excited about,0
getting to the location,0
its hidden in a street where there are public urinals and if it rains it becomes very muddy,0
secondly the two cab drivers they hired for the tours one was difficult to talk to because of the language barrier and the second was just plain rude other than that wonderful place,0
loved the bar atmosphere down stairs,0
rooms were clean and linens can dry cleaned which was nice,1
breakfast was a nice convenience and the happy hour drinks downstairs made for opportunities to meet people to tour the city with,0
only wish they had orchestrated some more hostel sponsored events to facilitate meeting people,0
i was lucky enough to but its a big place and people can tend to stick to themselves,0
staff were fantastic,0
location was walkable to downtown,0
no lockers which was a bit of a bummer and our dorm ensuite shower flooded though it was nicely renovated,0
some mirrors in the rooms would be handy,0
otherwise i thought it was clean and the air conditioning was a nice touch,1
personal lockers in the rooms 2 bathrooms in the room i stayed in,0
the location is by many places to see and do and if youre there for long theres a store across the street,0
they also have event so that their customers can hang out,0
the staff is nice and helpful when i go back to the tokyo area ill use emblem hostel again,0
very good,0
an amazing place to stay,0
very sociable,0
feels like living in a giant shared apartment,0
rooms dont have locks on them however there is a front door code,0
theres a nice homely vibe,0
the staff are also very helpful and accommodating,0
close to the waterfront but a bit away from downtown toronto,0
the area that its in is very trendy,0
great place,0
the place was great with very helpful and friendly stuff i and my friend never forgot this hostel and kindness of its stuffs,0
after finish my trip i suggest this place to my friend ,0
and i have booked this hostel for his trip too,0
everything was cool,0
security,0
nothing missing when leaving items in the bedrooms or the storage room,0
seems good and safe enough ,0
1st floor,0
not great for trying to get to sleep from the bar noise,0
other floors are much better for this just typical traffic noise ,0
washrooms toilets and showers are good enough,0
probably have to wait at points though people friendly enough staff and amicable roommates,0
people generally keep to themselves ,0
overall worth the money would use again,0
really cool quirky hostel with its own bar downstairs,0
friendly staff good transport links would stay again,0
really loved the stay here,0
would highly recommend plus it was very close to everything,0
there is no ac whatsoever,0
it was so hot and humid throughout my stay,0
apart from that the atmosphere was okay,0
if youre traveling alone you are bound to meet some people,0
i was there for 2 nights and met people both days,0
 ,0
the bar itself does not get to busy either but its decent enough,0
its well located and good bar vibe so ideal to meet people but the toilets are far from the rooms,0
its annoying to have to go through a bar to get to them,0
you have to put on your own sheets and the lockers arent very secure,0
everything was great except our bed was completely cracked in half with a big dip,0
we didnt bother to mention it though so cant say if they would fix it move us,0
probably shouldnt have a broken bed though they would have known,0
everything else was fab and the bar downstairs is great for meeting people and great food,0
comfortable hostel nice rooms nice showers friendly staff,0
only problem was the location  around 30 minutes walking from reichstag building the closest monument,0
also the kitchen was quite busy  long wait to use it,0
clean quiet apart from the room mate phoning home to south america at 230am,1
good breakfast and a pleasant part of london,0
my friend and i had a lovely time staying here,0
there were loads of offers and free social events in the bar which were great for meeting new people,0
we made a mistake when booking in that we didnt check that this was a hostel that allowed minors in shared dorms due to an error on my part,0
my friend was a month off 18 meaning upon arriving at the hostel we had to change our booking to a private room,0
the staff were eager to help and were very understanding ,0
i would definitely stay again,0
my friend had her apple watch stolen right from the charging dock on her bed our first night here,0
the beds have absolutely so space in between them making this incredibly easy to do,0
along with the fact that there were 18 of us shoved into one room like sardines,0
the environment at this hostel was very different from any other hostel i have stayed in,0
not as communal or friendly as others i have used,0
would not come back,0
really enjoyed my stay awesome location close to central easy access to tube,0
great location for anyone wanting to stay in the freidrichstain area,0
the place was super clean and the reception staff were very friendly and helpful,1
only draw back is that the communal kitchen has no equipment to cook other than a microwave and there is only plastic nonmicrowaveable cutlery available,0
rooms can get quiet stuffy as not all of them have air conditioning,0
overall it was a great place to stay especially travelling solo as there was lots of hostel activitiea and a big bar,0
although some review might be fake nowadays,0
i can honestly tell you this one is not,0
i really enjoyed my stay at hakone tent guesthouse,0
onsens were really nice rooms in typical traditional japanese style what i really liked staff was super friendly and the surrounding area is beautiful,0
i would like to do a special shout out to the staff who helped us planning our trip to mt fuji,0
i could not have wished for anything better,0
great hostel,0
loved that the beds had curtains made every bed feel like a private room,0
the containers under each bed were large and felt secure when locked,0
the individual showers and individual toilets with sinks were also quite nice,0
the shower curtains could have been cleaned more frequently but other than that it was very clean,1
breakfast is included if you book directly not through hostelworld,0
its yogurt toast cereal butter etc,0
awesome place amazing value for money all round,0
good location,0
very friendly and helpful staff,0
really enjoyed the barrestaurant and the rooftop outdoor area,0
our group was very comfortable at the hostel and arranged a couple outings through the hostel,0
we would stay there again ,0
wouldnt recommend this place,0
th location is really cool but everything else is just horrible,0
awsome place to meet new friends  especially in the common room,0
not the cleanest place or bathrooms but it does the job for a few nights,1
you do have to pay for linen though â‚¬4,0
and tourist tax gets added on for every night you stay there ,0
you would think it would be a one time fee per person,0
there is a bar in the common room and beers are between â‚¬2 and â‚¬3 each,0
not bad considering you get the cool neighborhood this hostel is located in,0
great value hostel,0
next door to the tube so very convenient also,0
discounts for guests at the pub downstairs too which had a good selection of beers and burgers,0
only slight is the staff were as warm and friendly as a chest infection  but so be it,0
i really do not recommend the bed on the top of a bunk bed because it gets too hot to sleep at night,0
very comfortable and homie and the perfect amount of liveliness and quiet,0
clean comfortable with great facilities,0
two words bed bugs saw bugs in bed horrid,1
went down stairs asked for a refund,0
which is not the worse the worse is when you go back home 1,0
didnt refund me,0
gave me some dry pasteur for free for breakfast 2,0
has to throw out 400 worth of luggage 3,0
has to buy tons of cleaners to kill the bugs 4,1
things that could not be cleaned had to be thrown away ,1
5,0
itching 6,1
the place is dirty 7,1
the area is horrid,0
i saw places no one would want to know exist in paris 8,0
cost hundreds,0
the best place in berlin for open minded friendly travellers from all over the world thankyou sandino for being the best,0
this hostel is amazing,0
perfect location with metro right next door the staff is friendly and helpful there is a brewery in there,0
you get a small pint for free,0
so you can try it before the atmosphere was also nice although its still hard to meet other travellers the dorms were spacious clean and comfortable the bathrooms were also clean and theres a cafe where you can have breakfast,1
circus hostel made my berlin experience unforgettable i was so sad to leave cant wait to comeback,0
overall i really enjoyed my stay here,0
the location is fantastic and value for money is incredible,0
free breakfast was so helpful and staff work hard,0
place was very clean and the building was beautiful,1
only problem i can think of is then lack of places to charge phones in rooms and toilets and showers are always in use,0
but obviously this would be the case when sharing a room with at least 10 other people,0
i would 100 recommend this place just make sure you bring a portable charger,0
the rooms were clean,1
but it is not in alexanderplatz,0
2 stations away,0
more importantly i wasnt satisfied with the safe lockers at all,0
they give you a drawer under your bed and you have to buy the lock to lock it,0
a lock that you dont have any use for it anymore,0
and drawers dont fit your carry on,0
they didnt give me any other options for safekeeping my luggage even though i asked for it and i am sure they had another option,0
not too much going on socially very mixed demographic due to it being part hotel part hostel but facilities are first class,0
we thoroughly enjoyed our stay at the young and happy hostel,0
the staff were kind friendly and so helpful,0
they even helped us how to figure out the metro routes to different places,0
overall there was a fun and lively atmosphere within the hostel itself and we found that the hostel was so central paris,0
really this is the best value you can get for the price,0
amazing staff really good atmosphere,0
its a bit far from the main tourist areas but if you dont mind being on the tube for half an hour this is the best,0
good location direct bus to airport ,0
amazing value for money friendly staff and 15 min metro ride to london centre,0
facilities are okay but bed is super noisy,0
otherwise can totally recommend,0
excellent hostel,0
friendly staff and amazing location,0
the rooms are big and the beds really good,0
awesome experience at the circus,0
lots of fun bars and restaurants just outside the door not to mention a bar downstairs at the hostel with their own craft beer,0
train and subway is just outside the front door so getting around the city is a breeze,0
would recommend anyone to stay here on their trip to berlin,0
nice hostel cozy little bit out of city centre but in a nice quarter and easy approachable with local transportation its quite so you can have a good sleep and rest,0
amazingly helpful and honest staff,0
allowed me to fit in way more than i initially thought i could and made everything seamless for me,0
cannot thank them enough,0
amazing atmosphere friendly  fun staff and great location,0
will definitely be visiting again,0
dahab hostel has one of the friendliest staffs and provides a safe and homey environment for everyone,0
the visitors and the staff at the hostel are amazing,0
my sister and i spent 2 nights at the phoenix hostel and it was a nice stay,0
we were in a room with a lot of people but it was nice,0
the cleanliness of the hostel is good though we did end up in a room with not very clean people,1
the staff was nice and very helpful,0
my sister and i didnt spend much time in the hostel per se as we mostly were hanging out in london but it served its purpose and the price and location close to baker st station  great to go to wembley stadium were good ,0
it would be good if the wifi connection is strong throughout the whole building,0
the place is very warm and welcoming ,0
the staff is very nice the beds are comfortable,0
it was great for my one night stay in london close to victoria coach station,0
the toilets were quite dirty though because they didnt flush well,1
other than that it was a very nice experience,0
this was my first hostel in india and i was pleasantly surprised by the standard and facilities,0
having just spent 7 months in south east asia this hostel exceeds the standards of most i stayed in dorms are spacious and clean staff are as friendly as you like 10 minute walk to a metro will stay here again thanks for hospitality,1
the location is great super close to the bus and amazing restaurants beds were pretty comfy ,0
peter and ashley were total sweetheart too and helped out with all our questions,0
its a very welcoming place only con is the washroom lay out but we got by just fine,0
tuvimos un problema la primera noche y nos dieron una habitaciÃ³n en,0
otro hostal al frente muy regular,0
despuÃ©s de esa noche,0
nos,0
quedamos,0
en el hostal,0
una habitaciÃ³n pequeÃ±a pero buen tamaÃ±o para 2 con baÃ±o privado,0
andy en recepciÃ³n no tenÃ­a buen inglÃ©s pero si fue muy servicial con lo que le pedÃ­amos,0
la ubicaciÃ³n es espectacular pasamos la mayorÃ­a del tiempo en la calle,0
hay muchas cosas por hacer y visitar en el Ã¡rea,0
tiene cerca trenes y hasta restaurantes de comida occidental,0
generator hostels are usually some of my top picks as the atmosphere is great which was much the same for this particular generator however the room sizes are absolutely tiny with very little space to even pull out the underbed lockers,0
the showers were not as clean as i was expecting either and there can be a lot of noise from the downstairs bar,1
on the whole the hostel maintains a good vibe and is in a great location,0
it is also pretty good value for money but it was just a little cramped,0
great time here,0
a lot of longterm residents,0
really cool folks,0
staff is nice,0
not a party hostel but you can definitely start one in the pool room in the basement with your own music hooked up to the speaker,0
nifty 247 convenience store around the corner for snacks booze and toiletry,0
right across the street from the tube ,0
and theres a huge park next door,0
pros within walking distance of two metro stations and in a welltodo area that felt safe free breakfasts were tasty the common room was nicely decorated and had a good vibe to it ,0
cons ,0
the staff came across as pretty incompetent and uninformed  they said the red fort light show was running when it was no longer on due to maintenance and gave us no information about the area or things to see and do the hostel flooded pretty badly during our stay rooms and bathrooms could have been cleaner,1
ensuite with one toilet room and another for the shower allowing people to use the toilet without blocking the shower in the morning,0
small lockers in the rooms too tiny to be of any real use yet the luggage storage in the entrance is shared and you dont even have to show a room key to the staff in order to get the key to get in,0
staff were kinda just there  not unfriendly but not really talkative either,0
breakfast was decent for the price,0
cleanliness amazing some places lacking in others,1
i only stayed one night on a long layover so wasnt there long enough to see the atmosphere,0
rooms were comfortable and quiet ,0
showers had toiletries and the rooms had a sink which was nice,0
location is not bad but you do have to get a bus to get to the subway,0
i had such a good time staying at citan and the location was perfect,0
the staff was warm and helpful,0
the common area was a little small but i think its because they build up their cafe and restaurantbar space to be the main socializing area,0
great bar with cheap drinks and an awesome view,0
staff is abit 5050 some were nice and some were rude,0
location is good if you like walking places ,0
the only big downside was the location was its achilles heal being 37degreees there was a fan in the room but we still needed the window open which leads to constant sirens,0
and a protest against wombats at 7am outside is just what you want  given its 25degrees it was sleepless long nights but kinda worth it for the hostel quality,0
i went to find a bed and there were no clean ones,1
i had to sleep in a bed that was used because they did not get it ready for me even when i came later than expected,1
security lockers were there but you had to pay for them and they were not in the rooms,0
very strange environment and felt very cramped,0
the room was extremely narrow with only the bed and space for one person to walk and harder when theres a ton of luggage on the floor,0
i was only here for one night so it wasnt the worst,0
area is really good,0
20 min walk to eiffel tower,0
staff was great and the beds were comfortable,0
nice bar to meet other people but the vibe wasnt very sociable for some reason,0
breakfast is pretty simple,0
overall good experience,0
stayed in a 6 bed mixed dorm,0
a first for me traveling solo,0
had no issues and found it to be in an excellent location between two different tube stops,0
would stay there again,0
great hostel,0
a big place with lots to do one minute walk to metro station that takes you all over paris for 2 euro,0
bathrooms in room and in the hallway restaurant and bar in the lobby,0
good place for single travelers or groups,0
beautiful place,0
loved the natural feeling to it,0
the staff was awesome,0
would recommend highly for the location ambience and the absolute value for money wish there were more washrooms though,0
hosteller is the best place to stay for both short and long period of time ,0
it was a good experience to meet people with different background and all around the world which gives an opportunity to meet new people with all experience  ,0
it was a really dissapointing stay  and unfortunately we were staying for 8 days,0
the people at the reception when we arrived were rude and we were super tired from our trip so they made it even more difficult for us,0
the showers and toilets were not clean our room was poorly ventilated and small for 8 people so it smelled awfully,1
also someone stole my things from the fridge and the stuff didnt care,0
wouldnt recommend it specifically for someone who has to stay for so many days,0
fantastic staff,0
great vibe within the hostel wonderful for solo travellers,0
easy location really close to transport food clubs bars and clothing stores,0
so much to offer,0
would definitely return,0
95 of the staff were fantastic,0
one of the younger guys didnt have much enthusiasm behind him like the rest of the stuff but that was the only real downside,0
breakfast could also have a little more variety but still good  delicious cocktails too,0
absolutely fantastic place to stay,0
so clean and lovely,1
big spacious sleeping area,0
friendly staff tea and coffee,0
amazing hostel,0
16 person dorms are hot but the location and staff cannot be beat,0
especially good for young people looking to meet others and have fun,0
amazing hostel,0
would be great for first timers,0
for groups of 4 or 6 sharing a room would be just as good as getting a hotel if not better due to the added atmosphere of the bar downstairs,0
other than the hot rooms i cant fault this place,0
best experience for me in this lovely hostel the owner and the manager are always paying attention to guests needs,0
many events met nice people enjoyed drinking and partying even you are solo its perfect place to hangout with others,0
location is great just few min walking to night life many convenient stores near by subway just 3 min walking,0
i will come definitly,0
you get what you pay for when booking here,0
not much of an atmosphere and the bunk beds feel shared because there isnt much of a divider between them,0
the location is great though nakano broadway is really fun and only one stop to the main parts of tokyo,0
the staff were unwelcoming and rude and ignored us whilst they played on their phones,0
the rooms were too hot due to their small size and lack of air conditioning,0
this meant that we had to keep the window open despite the really loud music that went on in the bar directly under the window,0
there were not enough toilets and showers in the bathroom to be suitable for a whole floor of people,0
everything was lovely,0
definitely at the higher end that im willing to pay but the great location made it even more worth it,0
warning that in summer it can get very hot in some of the rooms im good at dealing with heat but wouldnt recommend if you have trouble sleeping through heat,0
good place,0
clean and laid back,1
good security and friendly staff,0
a good location too near trains,0
this hostel has it all for the young and mature traveller,0
being somewhat older than most i was made to feel so welcome and included,0
staff  guests were super friendly,0
apart from my only little criticism being not enough bathrooms id recommend this particular hostel a place to go,0
stay here and youll not regret it,0
have fun yall,0
really enjoyed staying at comebackpackers,0
not the best hostel there is in terms of facilities but the atmosphere was awesome if you are young,0
lots of young people there when i was there,0
really enjoyed james staff member playlist at the common area and i must say he was a really friendly guy,0
would definitely come back,0
beautoful place with great location and friendly staff,0
from this place you can get to all popular locations in short time,0
overall everything was wonderful,0
my only concern is with the size of the lockers,0
i wish they could be a bit bigger,0
but that is very picky,0
i enjoyed my stay,0
wonderful hostel,0
stayed here when we first arrived in delhi and it was a great start to our trip,0
staff are so kind and amazing and go out of their way to help us with any query or question we had,0
the food is delicious the roof top is great for having evening beers and the hostel is right by a metro station with easy access to the rest of the city,0
highly recommend,0
wombats was a great hostel the rooms are really well kept new and spacious,0
bathroom was really nice,0
bed comfortable,0
facilities were great the bar was awesome and had great drink specials and things to do,0
a free waking tourpub crawl or other organised activities would have been good,0
wasnt the best for socialising mainly because of the size but also my dorm mates werent very friendly,0
breakfast was what youd expect of a hostel buffet,0
lots of space to chill outside the rooms ,0
i think out of my entire trip of two months this was my least liked hostel,0
location is good and the cafe downstairs is good as well and the staff were nice,0
the power point situation is terrible couldnt charge my phone except for in the cafe,0
the mens showers was pretty shocking,0
out of the 6 showers we had on our level 3 of the doors were broken so they wouldnt shut properly and the setup of the showers with a communal drain in the middle which you had to walk through to get to a stall,0
easy to get to from the airport friendlyhelpful staff great location near tons of restaurants bars shops,0
also and this is a big thing your experience in hostels is all about the people you meet and this hostel does a great job creating a fun environment where people want to make friends having a bar in the basement definitely helps ,0
would 100 recommend to a friend,0
the bar on the first floor made my stay all the more enjoyable,0
loved it here will definitely return,0
the only downside is that breakfast is only available untill 9 am ,0
great hostel  friendly staff  close to center and railway station ,0
awesome breakfast and coffe ,0
great place to stay ,0
i stayed only 1 day i wanna be choose again if i go to tokyo again  staffs were helpful and i liked bar good luck,0
everything was great,0
room was big and spacious the bathrooms were very clean and the staff was super friendly ,1
great location as well,0
the atmosphere was one of a kind,0
great location next to city center london,0
just a short subway away ,0
receptionistsbartenders were very helpful in working around me,0
the actual place was very secure and the facilities were very nice,0
i even appreciated it convenience for grabbing a drink ,0
the one thing i would say is that the location around it is not preferable,0
i never had any problems but being alone at the time was a bit uncomfortable ,0
we stayed here as a group of three on a family vacation,0
we did the vacation at the last moment and could not find an open hotel the first night,0
we booked a room at the lazy fox for the interim and that was a fabulous decision,0
the place was clean tidy and very cute,0
im a very social person and the common area was a great place to get information to help us plan our trip,0
super close to food options and the metro,0
breakfast was pretty simple but appreciated,0
small lockers so cannot store much within them,0
couldnt find staff half the time and one night guests were ringing door bell to check in however no owners answered,0
myself let them in and tried to contact the staff to help check them in this was around midnight,0
spent around half an hour ringing doorbell  calling emergency number but no sign,0
chapped on a staff only room door and a staff answered immediately,0
location is ok around 510 mins walk to nearest station,0
rooftop is nice,0
so dirty mouldy and damp that we couldnt stay ,1
i sat on the bed and got my trousers wet from the sheets,1
everything broken and run down,1
looked like a ck den,1
really clean and tidy and comfy beds,1
plenty of toilets and showers available,0
my only complaint is that all of the ladies toilets were closed for cleaning at the same time in the morning,0
id stay here again for sure,0
thanks,0
great location friendly staff room was small but functional ,0
the price was right and i felt safe ,0
5Â£ for a cheap towel was too much,0
i cannot give ratings on this hostel as we did not end up staying,0
our reservations were confirmed but they didnt end up having a bed for me,0
they put my son and i in an all female dorm room that didnt have any beds left,0
they end up finding a bed for my 18 yr,0
old son but no bed for me,0
i end up having to stay at a hotel for 125 pounds a night,0
we were just flying in from canada and veery jet lagged,0
it kind of blew our budget for a 2 month trip to europe and the uk,0
very unorganized hostel,0
i loved staying here,0
it was so convenient to the oxford circus tube station and was right in the middle of a very fun part of town but not noisy at all,0
rooms were clean and very comfy,1
staff was all very very helpful,0
very clean and nice hostel,1
staff are very nice rooms are really comfortable,0
there are lockers in the rooms which work only with the key to your room so big plus,0
it is situated quite far away and to get there or to berlin centre you need to get the metro,0
its too far to walk definitely,0
theres quite a few bars around the hostel so it was very loud at night hard to fall asleep,0
but you cant do anything about that,0
the bathrooms were really gross to be in and its pretty terrible,1
that if youre in one side of the shower all the water from the other showers across runs through your shower and into yours,0
the rooms were insanely hot for summer in london there really needs to be aircon or at the very least a fan especially disappointed in that because i was in a private room,0
the basin was dirty when i got to the private room,1
my private room had bunk beds instead of a double,0
clean and safe but there is only 1 shower for all of the guests maybe 2 if you count the one we are not really supposed to use downstairs no lounge area no activities and shotty wifi,1
it is basically a family home with a hostel squeezed into the upper floor,0
the breakfast is decent and the staff is friendly enough,0
however they could not even leave a baguette out for me when i asked if i could get my breakfast an hour,0
or so early because i had to catch a train,0
this very good real hotel they look like a happy family they very much help to me thanks for everything,0
this place has a huge number of stairs and some seriously weird residents,0
other than that the place is okay,0
had some items stolen from me however when i asked the staff they just shrugged and looked at me like i was annoying them,0
good hostel,0
very clean and quiet,1
plenty of privacy if required,0
real family feeling,0
the dorms can look a bit random at first,0
but when you settle in its very homey,0
facilities have a good set up easy to move around and clean,0
staff very helpful and even helped us connect our sim card we bought somewhere else,0
only thing is the closest station is subway so something to note if you are a jr pass holder,0
otherwise easy to get around,0
good quality sushi nearby too,0
decent location,0
prices for food were a little expensive around the area,0
the hostel promotes 25 off food at the bar downstairs but the kitchen was closed every time we wanted to get food,0
the rooms were dirty with dust and hair and the air conditioner leaked,1
really nice stay,0
the hostel is nice furnisched and the staff on the top ,0
bed a bit high in the dorms but rooms are nice,0
we had a great stay at the hostel and met a lot of really nice people  ,0
our room was big quiet and with a perfect bathroom,0
nice place but the bunkbeds were squeaky,0
the room got a bit stuffy even when the ventilation was on,0
great hostel  clean bathrooms ac good breakfast,1
the bar and restaurant below the hostel is great and they offer a 25 discount for people staying there,0
rooms get very hot the windows do not open wide and there are no fans in the rooms ,0
security could have been better but overall enjoyed my stay,0
best hostel ever ,0
niko d,0
neg worst stay  longest  sleepless night on our entire trip through europe,0
it was a hot miserable night,0
we got a room on the 7th floor and fanfan coils did not work,0
walls made of cement,0
window opens,0
my favorite of the hostels of beijing so far,0
the only two good things about this hostel are its location and costbreakfast included ,0
honestly the facilities were okay though they dont have elevator for 4th floors guests ,0
ohh,0
i forgot that no ac was awful ,0
when i tried to checkin before arriving their homepage was crazy and didnt work so i just went to reception directly the day i checked in ,0
i waited almost an hour in the lobby and idk how to explain the situation,0
it was just amazing in bad side you know cheap is cheap,0
the staff are amazing and they provide for breakfast and snacks,0
anytime you feel hungry the is something in the kitchen to eat,0
amazing,0
great theme atmosphere and people,0
my 10 person room was extremely nice spacious and had a full balcony,0
there are tons of resources to find activities and get discounts and the staff are very helpful,0
i love the quirkiness of the place and its close enough to walk to many major sites ,0
my only concern was that the lockers were too small for a full backpack so i just had lock up my valuables and hope nobody rifled thru my clothes ,0
would stay again,0
beds were terribly uncomfortable,0
wifi barely worked,0
crowded common areas,0
excellently located in holland park,0
multiple train and bus options nearby,0
the curtains on the bed give you an ability for some privacy,0
the showers are fairly clean,1
the staff was absolutely divine,0
very nice staff perfect location,0
the dorm door only closes from the inside or by putting the code in so a lot of people leave it open which doesnt feel secure,0
great location bar and staff,0
cleanliness was the only issue but didnt outweigh my great experience overall at all,1
this was quite a nice hostel super close to the metro which makes it really easy to get to and from all the attractions,0
kept clean daily with only a little mold in shower,1
found the atmosphere a bit lacking with the roof top bar closing early,0
great place to stay would stay again,0
great breakfast,0
easy to get to with the directions they give,0
easy 40 min walk to the berlin central train station which really isnt bad at all if you dont have a lot of luggage,0
you get to walk through the tiergarten on the way,0
clean enough,1
id stay there again,0
fair warning a lot of teenagers stay here and i do mean a lot,0
my room was full of adults but the kids above and below us were obnoxious at night,0
if you can deal with that not a bad place to stay at all,0
nice place really relaxed and laid back atmosphere little security measures but in a quiet area anyway  breakfast is great,0
check in is really late room was ready at about 1,0
but we werent allowed in it until 4,0
unnecessary and annoying when youve been on a flight arriving at 530am,0
quite far from tourist destinations pasmo travel card is a necessity,0
the wall of places to visit and directions in the hostel so handy fantastic idea,0
room was on kitchen level staff cook smelly food,0
over it was good,0
but i dont like how they do not check each person card when they come in,0
the sheets could be replaced they looked dirty,1
but i was too tired to do anything about it,0
so i slept in them,0
they served coffee orange juice toast yogurt and cereal for breakfast which was nice,0
had to pay for towels,0
staff seemed unprofessional,0
they charged my card then told me they couldnt use it because of potential fraud even with my passport in staff members hand,0
that didnt make sense to me and it held my card limit up for 3 days and i had to then pay cash for room which was obnoxious,0
environment was okay,0
but i wouldnt go back,0
i left early one morning for an event,0
and according to the other girls in my girls only room the staff let two males and a female in after i left,0
all of my stuff from my bed were dumped on the floor and some strange man slept in it,0
then apparently another staff came and kicked them out but they stayed until the afternoon,0
its incredibly violating and clearly there is absolutely no security,0
i will tell everyone i know not to go near this hostel,0
i enjoyed my stay with lovely people and overall the fantasticsmiling faces and hard working staff the staff are very helpful and with full patience,0
a really nice hostel with great staff,0
have been so helpful in getting an item we left in the room upon checkout,0
great location and we were lucky enough to get a balcony on the 10th floor,0
the hostel situates in the heart of the eastern berlin minutes walking distance to the famous eastern berlin gallery,0
the hostel building itself is humongous resembling the architecture style of the old soviet union,0
i quite enjoyed my stay one only improvement to be made the room better to be equipped with the air conditioner in the future,0
the hostel had no hot water when we there and we had to have freezing showers in the morning which really wasnt nice at all,0
apparently it had been this way for a couple weeks already which to me seems like way too long to fix such an important problem,0
if it wasnt for that we would have been able to enjoy the hostel more,0
the hostel was really nice staff were lovely and very accommodating ,0
the location is good your about 4 minute walk from the metro line ,0
the whole place is so clean ,1
however the beds are very hard so not very conformable ,0
overall a really lovely hostel,0
 clean and nice hostel friendly staff,1
interesting hostel more like a hotel because i had gone during the world cup and most of my roommates were out,0
there were few to no activities to get to know other people staying in the hostel and hence make friends,0
the location was prime ten minute walk to the central train station and express bus stop to tegel airport,0
20 min walk to the administrative central,0
very worth it for the price,0
loved the old delhi food tour and great food in hostel,0
great location walking distance to effiel tower and back,0
2 metro stops on line 8 near by and good food  gelato,0
grocery market around corner ,0
stayed in a girls only dorm which all were very respectful  nice,0
little lockers with self digital code to use per person in room for important stuff,0
if you are staying on the weekend bring ear plugs because of people stay up late outside at the bar,0
only concern was my big bag in a closet room with everyone elses stuff but is behind locked door,0
the hostel is really far away from anywhere central,0
while i was staying there i encountered a few weird guests which seemed to be staying there long term,0
they also had a bunch of school kids staying there which i found annoying as they closed the outside area off to everyone there ,0
overall i wouldnt recommend it unless youre desperate theres not a lot to do in the area besides some pubs which closed early,0
i only stayed there because i was desperate and everywhere was already booked,0
there is a shower toilet and sink in the room ,0
the only option in the shower room if you wanted to keep your clothes dry was to keep your fresh clothes right outside the door and quickly grab them ,0
the toilet is also in a separate room from the main room but the sink is in the same room which can lead to a lot of noise ,0
the provided towel was very small and the wifi was horrendous ,0
however it cost less than 30 euros per night,0
the bar and employees were delightful and helpful,0
had a really good time here,0
very helpful staff,0
for sure recommend the offer of the driver from the hostel for a pick up from the airport,0
although i was delayed he kept waiting for me,0
i had a 20 hr stopover in cairo and was thinking to visit the museum,0
because of very good advice and a good deal from the hostel i was able to visit the pyramids and dropped off at the airport afterwards,0
what a great experience,0
rooms were very affordable and i even had airco,0
in the morning breakfast  coffee,0
everything was great,0
would definitively stay there again,0
i really loved my stay in ttp hostel,0
the staff is really nice and always willing to help also thanks to this hostel i met really great people and i enjoyed every second here ,0
definitely i will come back here ðŸ˜Š,0
terrible accommodation,0
bathroom smelled really bad and no one cleaned it though out our stay,1
they charged us 5â‚¬ each to do our laundry except they ruined all of our clothes,0
they left it in the washer for for over 8 hours because they dryer wouldnt work unless closed with tape or something pushed against it,0
we didnt get our money back,0
and we had to get rid of most of our clothes,0
the staff wasnt very sympathetic or friend it really ruined our trip to berlin,0
great hostel and staff ,0
jovita was super cool ,0
i wish every place i stayed at had someone like her ,0
the place also attracts awesome residents ,0
i hope to come back soon,0
the hotel was good overall,0
everything was satisfying,0
nothing to complain  except that it is still a bit overpriced,0
judging from my stay experience this place does not surpass other delhi hostels that much so i do not know why it requires much more money especially with a quite distant location,0
oscar and the rest of the staff you guys are amazing,0
so humble and generous,0
couldnt have asked for a better experience whilst staying at ikidane house for my first trip to japan,0
will definitely return there in the future,0
managed to make great friends with other travellers and the hosts ,0
lots of love to y,0
all ray,0
for the most part this hostel was good,0
secure clean nice comfy atmosphere and friendly staff,1
the only downsides were that i had to walk almost an hour to get to the main part of berlin,0
theres a bus not too far away,0
but i prefer to walk,0
also i had gotten used to having my own electric socket at other hostels bunks,0
not this one,0
there were 2 for the whole room of 4 people so two of us didnt get to charge our phones overnight,0
also you have to make your own bed,0
staff was very friendly and helpful,0
one major problem was that there was no staff working overnight,0
both nights i stayed here there were a group of guests that seemed,0
not aware that many of us were sleeping at 430 in the morning,0
they were talking so loudly that they woke up our entire dorm room 2 nights in a row,0
walls are paper thin which doesnt help,0
anyway that problem could be fixed with 24 hour staff to provide gentle reminders,0
also lots of ants and the toilets were very tiny,1
while the lobby was nice and the staff was accommodating the rooms and bathrooms left something to be desired,0
there was very little air flow and with fans costing 20 euros to rent sweat is in your future,0
the showers are also communal,0
excellent location very near gare du nord which was what i needed,0
nice international staff,0
room and bathroom were small but should be expected in an expensive city as paris,0
would like to thank the serbian night staff for telling the pakistani guest hassling me to leave me alone,0
thanks man,0
experience has been amazing,0
staff is extremely helpful and friendly,0
place is really clean and central,1
thank you people for making my holiday so memorable,0
just cant wait to back there ,0
best gianni from italy,0
this a great hostel,0
staff are friendly and helpful,0
room are nice and clean,1
will recommend 100,0
great spot for savvy travellers looking for a place to crash and easy access to all that london has to offer,0
the price is good for london and being next to kings cross means quick travel anywhere you want to go,0
unfortunately the common areakitchen is in the basement and some of the facility is in need of repair in fact someone was renovating one of the showers while we were there,0
basement air is very good in spite of there being no windows,0
bed was comfy,0
pillows were too flat,0
probably wouldnt recommend this hostel to anyone unless youre travelling in a big group,0
no decent common area to meet other travellers and the location not that great if you want to be able to walk to the major sites,0
we liked the people we met here and the free rice,0
however it is filthy,1
there was some mouldy food in one of the lockers in our room that hadnt been cleaned out by the previous occupant and the staff didnt unlock and clean the locker out until the day we left so the room we stayed in stank,1
the staff arent professional they are nice and chilled and all,0
but theyre a bit too chilled ,0
for what you pay i suppose its okay but its just like staying in a dirty student house,1
its coo,0
really nice place with a fun pub downstairs,0
plenty of showers and lots of space and privacy in the dorms,0
this hostel could definitely use a deep clean especially the floors and showers,1
the private room was a good size but there was no ac and probably 30degrees in that room,0
however it was fine for our one night stay in toronto and relatively close to the cne and budweiser stage,0
one of the best hostels ive stayed at,0
leregent is a perfect taste of paris ,0
its located in such a great area literally a 3 minute walk to the gorgeous sacrecouer and theres a train station right out the front that gives you access to all of the great things paris has to offer ,0
the staff were friendly and helpful whenever we needed them ,0
we stayed in the twin private room and it was great,0
very clean had everything we needed and even a gorgeous little balcony to enjoy the sunset,1
would highly recommend this hostel ,0
great place overall,0
each guest gets a ticket for a free beer or glass of wine at the bar and a brochure with maps and great suggestions for things to doplaces to eatuseful german phrases,0
u bahn stop is less than a block from the hostel,0
one of the best place to stay in delhi,0
avinash and manisha are great hosts ,0
the hostel is very clean and colourful,1
the hand paintings are awesome ,0
a must to stay place,0
awesome place to stay,0
everyone is extremely polite and friendly and all the facilities are great,0
best place to meet travellers,0
this hostel was clean enough had a great location and an okay atmosphere but the customer service was terrible,1
the staff was rude and had no respect for my belongings which the cleaning staff threw on the floor twice and very little respect for me as a person when i asked the front desk questions,0
i will not be staying at this hostel again,0
great area with restaurants  bars within walking distance,0
i like the fact that each dorm bed has a place to charge your phone,0
nice communal area both inside  outside for summer days,0
this was my first hostel experience and i really enjoyed it,0
there is a fun bar downstairs and they have a pub crawl every night that i highly recommend to meet people,0
only issues are that its on a busy road so at night when theres less traffic people speed down the road making a lot of noise,0
also the beds are a bit rickety,0
besides that it was a great experience and would recommend,0
a fantastic place for anyone wanting great affordable accommodation in one of the best cities in the world,0
the staff are friendly welcoming and very attentive,0
i highly recommend when the sushi making workshop is on as its a great way to meet people and to eat sushi,0
a huge thank you to all at ks house tokyo for making my first city experience in japan a dream come true,0
arigato gozaimasu,0
a great place to meet new people,0
theres always people hanging out and everyones very friendly,0
its right near the sumo rings and is a five minute walk to the subway and the inner jr lines,0
the staff are very helpful and nice,0
there is a funky feet smell in the rooms and a bit in the lobbies etc,1
but the smell is really not that bad and you forget about it after a few minutes,1
even though my room was right in front of the train tracks i forgot about the noise thanks to the windows,0
had a great time at the hostel and this is due to the people i met,0
my only bad experience in the hostel is to do with the elevator it is extremely slow and needs to be fixed immediately,0
the food was drinks were good and the staff were extremely helpful,0
i believe the hostel could do more to bring the guests together such as games night or even pub crawls as there were some people who could mingle due to their shy personalities or based on everything surrounding around drinking,0
nice place very clean and friendly,1
excellent vibe,0
felt very comfortable here,0
grids was my very first hostel ever,0
i was really nervous because im not familiar with how shared space would be but my experience here was superb,0
staff were friendly the place is spotless because they clean like three times a day,1
everyone is very respectful of each others space and quiet time,0
showers and bathroom are always so spotless and this is coming from a person that easily gets grossed out,1
the location is decent tucked away from loud streets,0
10 min walk to train station,0
i only stayed here one night on a weekday but overall the hostel seemed great,0
the main hang out area has a bar and a few games and people were mostly chilling on their phones or laptops,0
there is secure locker storage if you arrive before checkin,0
my room was literally on the rooftop which has an amazing view over the city including montmarte and the eiffel tower,0
4 person dorm was clean and quiet ensuite bathroom was nearly spotless ac was great and bed was comfy,1
great neighborhood too,0
really nice installations of the hostel new and clean,1
nice location to arrive by bus or subway to every important place in london,0
good services to offer internet cafe bar luggage saver,0
a very nice hostel,0
it is based a little out of the center of berlin but getting a unlimited day train pass or even a week is easy and relatively cheap,0
the underground is 4min walk and a bus stop is right outside,0
the hostel itself has a very modern inside comfy beds and nice rooms,0
the lockers in your room are only big enough to lock up a small backpack or some personal belongings although there are larger lockers downstairs,0
bathrooms were small but nice,0
all in all a great hostel,0
we found our stay here to be awful there was no assistance from the staff,0
we asked for water to fill our drink bottles and were sent to the dirty outside garden tap which did not look clean,1
we were kicked out of our room from 113 we paid for a room which we were unable to access for 4 hours a day,0
we had to drop off our key to front reception every time we left the hostel this did not make us feel safe about our belongings,0
the place was dirty and smelt like mould,1
the cleanest hostel ive been in within japan so far,1
i absolutely loved how clean it was,1
for a capsule bed you dont need to make your own bed which ive had to do at a couple other places,0
fresh towels are also provided everyday,0
i think the main downside is the location is not the most convenient spot in the city,0
the reception staff made our stay here always chatty and kind,0
lost key and purse while at the hostel and staff were extremely helpful in dealing with both incidents,0
facilities were very clean and hostel was well run,1
only negative was the rooms got very warm at night ,0
i had a great stay at imano hostel,0
the location cant be beat and the staff are wonderful friendly and helpful,0
i wouldnt count on staying there more than a couple days though,0
the mattresses are paper thin which made it for a very uncomfortable sleep,0
the pro to that is that when you wake up you want to get out f bed right away so at least you dont waste your time lying around,0
if you are gay this is the best place to stay because it is by all the gay bars in shinjuku,0
overall great thoug,0
it is really near to asakusa shopping streets but still a quiet place to stay,0
staff are very friendly and i got an ice cream for typhoon treat last time and my roommate got a cake for her birthday,0
really fun to stay here and a little sad to go but life has to go on  ,0
thank you so much rb,0
very pleased to have discovered you,0
will evinitelgbtsexagain here and in europe ,0
but it could be good to have shower shampoo dispenser in shower as well as besides basin  in private room,0
i enjoyed the horse and stables and probably will go back,0
friendly staff excellent music and atmosphere at the bar good location,0
thank you,0
really good hostel for the value with a very friendly and helpful staff,0
the beds were wide and comfortable with a shelf reading light and outlet to relax in,0
there were wide storage locker for your valuables super close to a subway line what more could you want,0
ended up meeting another solo traveler and we ended up going to kyoto together due to the bond we were able to make at this hostel,0
highly recommend ,0
very helpful staff and nice place,0
in a good location,0
i really liked this hostel,0
the staff was helpful and everything was really clean,0
the best part though is definitely the terrace on the roof,0
its a great place to hang out and meet other people from the hostel and it has an amazing view of the city,0
the neighborhood is less touristic than other parts of paris which i enjoyed,0
it is a ways away from the major things in the city but the metro is really close and extremely easy to use,0
overall this hostel was very nice and comfortable,0
very nice ac and rooms,0
the bathrooms couldve been cleaner and the showers are quite small,1
located in a nice part of kings cross and close to transportation but semi far from everything in london,0
also which it is my fault for not reading and reviewing but there is no age limit,0
me and my sister were in a 4 person room and two men 40 checked in at 2am and were put in our room,0
once again my fault for not checking but still uncomfortable,0
shabby but good location,0
the neighborhood is a bit distant from the city center but its still a great hostel,0
great hostel,0
i stayed in the 6mixed room,0
beds were comfortable and temperature was great with the ac,0
each bed had its own light charging station and space to put your stuff,0
the curtain for each individual bed is a nice touch for privacy as well,0
staff was always friendly and helpful no matter the time of the day ,0
breakfast was alright and a good time to meet new people tables get pretty full so you get to share a table with other people,0
pub crawl was really fun and worth the price,0
first time staying at a hostel was here only 2 nights because i had already rented an airbnb,0
this place was clean nice and in a great location also met alot of travelers from all over the world,1
would definitely stay here again and for the price they offer so much,0
great place to stay,0
beware that you need to verify your stay by email something that is very different from what i have experienced here on hostelworld before,0
the lack of an elevator was tough ,0
i dont recall that being listed on the information online ,0
it would have been nice to have been able to request a bottom bunk and receive a room on a lower floor as well ,0
the option for a room with all the same gender would have been great as well and for noise complaints to have been taken seriously,0
room was not big but the people i met there were rly cool,0
underground station is very near and the london bridge and the tower bridge are close,0
reception was not open 24 hrs but overall i enjoyed my stay,0
no locker in my room so kept my valuables with me,0
hostel had great facilities and amenities but did not have an atmosphere to take advantage of them,0
seems better suited for families,0
there were also a lot of school trips happening when i went so the breakfast area was filled with kids,0
it was great to stay in an area of berlin away from the usual suspects  the neighbourhood is a quiet and leafy suburb,0
the hostel itself is really nice with a wellfinished lobby,0
we were given free ice creams when we arrived as it was so hot,0
,0
during the heatwave,0
checkin and checkout is smooth,0
access is via a key code and key to the dorm so feels secure,0
good facilities and clean showers etc,1
no complaints,0
reception staff were helpful in directing us to the bus to get to station,0
its a bigger hostel so i feel as though it was a little difficult to meet people,0
its a short walk to the tube which is awesome and it was very clean,0
felt secure with keycard licks to the gates and rooms,0
the staff were not overly friendly ,0
it wasnt very clean ,1
the location  well it was close to sacre coeur and gare du nord so if that works for you its good ,0
it didnt feel like the safest street ,0
there was never any free coffee which is disappointing,0
had a mixed stay at this hostel in berlin,0
first off it was in a great central location and we ended up being able to walk pretty much anywhere,0
the staff were helpful and the laundry service was great and efficient,0
now for the down sides it was unbelievably hot when we stayed in august no air con and no fans offered,0
this meant all windows were open which let in the noise from the courtyard which was active well into early morning,0
it didnt feel very clean and showers were grimy and basic,1
do not stay here,0
this was the worst hostel i have ever stayed at,0
i was in a private room by myself and at 2am in the morning while i was sleeping some guy who worked at the hostel came into my room,0
he claimed to be checking to see if the previous guests had left but at 2am in the morning after i had already checked in,0
wtf,0
as a young solo female traveler this was my worst nightmare,0
i was refunded the money for the night,0
but then my shoes were stolen from my room while i was away,0
greatly enjoyed my stay,0
welcoming staff and the hostel is near to a subway station making it easy to get to wherever in tokyo ,0
the common area often has people hanging around making it great for meeting folks,0
the hostel has no air conditioning in the rooms especially the private room that we booked,0
temperatures were unbearable as london had temperatures of about 31 degrees,0
we did not enjoy our stay although the location was good and close to many attractions,0
i was only here one night,0
but it was pretty good,0
kind of far away from the action,0
friendly staff,0
good atmosphere clean,1
but the lockers in rooms were the tiniest lockers ive ever used in my life,0
and you couldnt lock any of your luggage in there,0
other than that is was a great place,0
great location,0
right in the middle of east side berlin where theres loads of great street food,0
staff very helpful right next to public transport which easy to use,0
photos of room wasnt what we got and toiletshower facilities werent great,0
make sure you choose the hotel option not hostel if you want the room shown on the website,0
the hostel is acceptable,0
however it has some drawbacks,0
in the first place the hostel page says that it has a kitchen,0
this is a missleading expression because it is not possible to cook there,0
they only have a microwave and a sink,0
i was not the only person that felt cheated about this,0
in the second place some electric connections in the room were not working,0
there is nothing very special about this hostel,0
there are no activities in it nor a kitchen neither a bar so it is only useful,0
great place you can find a good company also ,0
good breakfast ,0
the only problem is that the rooms are hot with no fans or air conditioning,0
we really enjoyed our stay at plus berlin,0
the staff are wonderful and willing to assist in any way to help make your stay more comfortable,0
the hostel itself is huge and so i was even more impressed with how clean the rooms and even corridors were,1
whilst not central to the main plazas it is very close to public transport which is very easy to navigate and relatively inexpensive to use and is also close to the east side gallery and a hub of wonderful eats and funky shops at friedrichshain,0
this hotel needs much improvement,0
i was horrified with the room ,0
wallpaper peeled off the walls mould behind wallpaper damp smell,1
i complained and instead of giving me another room they charged me more for another room,0
dont book this place,0
its a complete let down ,0
great location really close to the train station  fantastic staff especially martin the barman  very clean decent facilities,1
good location nice coffee from the cafe in the garden,0
room was quite spacious however there is absolutely no airconditioning or fans making it extremely stuffy and uncomfortable in the rooms on 34 degree days,0
the showers also smelt like you were standing in a urinal which was pretty unpleasant,1
nice location and helpful staff,0
i was only there for 1 night and just needed a bed for the night but got a good nights sleep for a very reasonable price,0
the hostel seemed friendly and social but still possible to have a quiet rest at night,0
only thing i missed was more power sockets in the room but that was a very minor annoyance and i would consider staying there again if coming back to berlin,0
the hostel is in the perfect location so easy to get to as its just a few minutes walk from blackfriars and st pauls underground stations,0
the staff were really friendly and helpful,0
the room was basic but clean and the beds were comfy so we slept very well,1
i will definetly be staying here again,0
pretty good stay,0
i didnt go to the bar at all but there were some lovely people in my room,0
dirty,1
uncomfortable facility,0
unfriendly night islamic male staff,0
the location is a bit far 2030 minute tube ride to everything but the hostel was wonderful,0
a perfect place for a solo traveller if you want to meet new people,0
perfect location in the heart of le marais nice venue,0
unfortunately absolutely no hostel atmosphere school classes no drinks allowed although the really nice courtyard would be perfect to meet people,0
no air con staff admonished me at breakfast just to have one little baguette when i wanted to take a second,0
the breakfast is included but not really good considering the price of 40 eur for a 10 bed dorm,0
dont go there as a solo traveller but look for cooler places in the area which is nice,0
good place but be wary,0
security is the worst thing about this place,0
no lockers or place to secure your valuables,0
my laptop and another person gear was stolen on my first day,0
very misfortunate,0
and im sure it rarely happens,0
but it did,0
other than that the place is chill,0
bathrooms clean and run nice cold and hot water,1
breakfast is fulfilling and good,0
bed is okay,0
but wifi does not reach to the last floor,0
when connected though wifi is strong,0
the location is great and close to subwaytube,0
nice location and comfortable bed,0
staff are all friendly and willing to help,0
the cafe has good offer for snack too,0
however the bathroom is very tiny and no enough storage space for everyone in the room  eg 6ppl room with only 4 lockers it will be a lot better if everyone has their little own space,0
nice hostel in hendon central,0
the staff is super nice the place is clean,1
it is located about 10 min metro from all the activities and then gives yoi the chance to visit a charming less touristic surrounding of london,0
this place is a toilet,1
loud all the time rude staff hot rooms very squeaky beds filthy toilets and showers covered in vomit untidy and dirty common areas with randoms loitering the hallways being loud all the time,1
the area is not much better,0
they only take cash,0
yeah,0
thats not suss at all,0
happy to say i would never stay here again or visit willesden for the rest of my life,0
worst hostel,0
great place for the money,0
5 minute walk to metro and close enough to the main attractions that your not spending all your time inat the metro,0
would recommend and would stay here again next time im in berlin,0
great hostel close to every major attraction as well as to the metro line,0
clean comfortable and is incorporated to bellushis bar which meant the party never stopped,1
i would certainly recommend it to everyone,0
first i couldnt find the hostel from the airport abit hard to locate comfortable bed but didnt really sleep because the ac leaked and my bed got wet,0
rooms smelled not really cleaned everyday or bin emptied,1
showers had no hot water and no mat in case i slipped out of the shower toilets smelled terrible and no toilet paper,1
i did like the atmosphere staff and hostel guests were great fun to be around,0
breakfast was good and basic,0
its just the stairs it a long way up with a suitcase,0
awesome hostel,0
they occasionally do free dinners which was a good treat,0
the staff was absolutely amazing and they definitely made the experience great,0
the rooms are also pretty clean and it was a great place to meet people ,1
only downside was the wifi didnt work in the rooms very well,0
brian is an awesome host,0
he has events planned throughout the week for guests and a plethora of recommendations for places to eat things to do,0
the house is clean and has a nice community feel,1
the breakfast of eggs toast peanut butter nutella is enough to get you started for a day of exploring the house is a ideal location less than a ten minute walk from the street performers,0
im excited to return,0
in a great location for shinjukukabukicho,0
we found it easy to get to and from the train stations with no problem,0
not much in terms of security for personal belongings lockers etc,0
and its not really a social hostel,0
the place was very clean and the staff were very friendly,1
unfortunately my room was a bit dirty and the personal space is a bit limited,1
the staff is great though and the rooftop offers a great view over downtown,0
although it says alexanderplatz its 2 stations away from alexanderplatz station,0
however its located in a nice neighbourhood with cute brunch shops,0
quite difficult to meet people unless you get along with people in the room,0
by far this was the worst hostel i have ever stayed at,0
the check in system was appalling and so slow,0
the wifi did not work for the 4 days i was there and when i asked them they continuously said they are currently working on getting it fixed for 4 days,0
there were not enough chargers in the rooms,0
the lockers were broken,0
the access to the laundry room was broken,0
room keys did not work,0
showers were terrible with bad privacy,0
so many issues and no one addressingfixing them,0
great place to stay aircon i rooms would be great as they are so hot and stuffy,0
the area that the hostel is located in is a bit sletchy especially walking around at night,0
nice space to sit and have breakfast on the canal,0
room door was broken therefore locked in out of the room and the tap only ran hot,0
i reported the issue to staff who reassured me that maintenance would fix it right away,0
the issue was not resolved during my stay,0
on the night prior to departure a fellow traveller enlightened me that they raised the same issue to staff three months prior,0
clearly the hostel do not take these issues seriously,0
very decent hostel,0
staff was great,0
breakfast was good and quick,0
rooms were clean,1
will be staying here again ,0
rooms were clean for an average hostel,1
bedding was thrown in a bag im glad i brought my own blanket the pillow was flat,0
the ac did not work well but we requested a fan that the stuff brought in for us,0
overall the hostel is located perfectly in downtown toronto,0
you can see the cn tower from the park,0
i would stay here again if i get the chance to visit toronto again,0
great staff and amazing location,0
a bit noisy and smokey as we had a room with a window to the inner courtyard but overall really great,0
amazing hostel,0
booked it for two nights and ended up extending it to my whole stay in seoul ,0
really good location helpful and friendly staff everything is just perfect,0
everything was superb during my stay here i booked a bed in a 6 bed dorm and it was big enough to make you feel comfortable,0
all the facilities in general were clean and seemed to be pretty new and the bed space had some nice detailes like usb charges and a personal light that really comes handy,1
just bear in mind if you are travelling solo this hostel,0
its a big one and some people stay there for 1 night so it might not be the best option if you are looking to make friends or party everyday,0
i should never believe what people write as reviews,0
the hostel is decent but nothing special really,0
nothing,0
the 3 level bunk beds are not comfortable and too many people cramped in the rooms and the app wasnt clear when i wanted the pods but they put me in that horrible room instead i actually left away to another hostel because i couldnt stand it,0
even the bathrooms dont have any amenities i mean come on even in 3rd world hostels youll find some shampoo at least how cheap can you be,0
never,0
i was visiting toronto for the labor day weekend and found this the only decently priced accommodation in the city,0
i was a little skeptical at first about this place reading the previous reviews,0
but it could not be further from the truth,0
the staff were good and helped me drop my bags at the reception since i reached before the 2pm checkin time ,0
the rooms and bathrooms were quite and cleaned regularly,1
the usp is the location which is in the centre of kensington market,0
the breakfast was so good the location of the hotel was not bad  about 30 minute far from the eiffel tower ,0
the bus station is close to the hotelbut the wasnt a hair dryer in hostel,0
sweet place,0
good location,0
private room with bath and shower was dope,0
for a first timer it was super nice,0
the hostel was good and security was good the cleanliness however was questionable,0
there was blood on the wall in the female bathroom for the whole 4 days we were there and when they clean the beds they dont replace the comforter just fold it up and leave it,1
very professionally ran hostel facilities are well kept and clean,0
staff are very helpful and happy,0
good and drinks available to have in a really nice common room ,0
rooms can get very hot though and windows very limited opening,0
staff was extremely rude to guests,0
they only focus on collecting their money,0
they are not helpful at all,0
the hostel felt like a hotel ,0
i dont believe the staff know what theyre doing,0
every single day someone was assigned to the wrong bed or room,0
i got tired of them in my room verifying ids,0
no ambiance continental breakfast costs 7 euros towels costs 9 euros and you cant bring your own food to eat theres no common area,0
i will not recommend staying here if youre on a budget,0
i was rudely awoken on the morning of my checkout by a strange man in my room,0
he did not identify himself as a member of staff nor was he wearing anything to show that he was working there,0
he began screaming at me in broken english that i was not allowed to be there when in fact i had under an hour until checkout,0
i found this very threatening and uncomfortable and as a young woman travelling on her own i would not recommend aloha hostel for this reason,0
my first choice among hostels in london,0
pickwick hall is clean comfortable really well located and not that expensive,0
omg best hostel ive stayed at couldnt ask for anything better from a hostel,0
the building is beautiful and the inside is equally beautifully mostly furnished in wood,0
the staff are very friendly and helpful the beds are comfortable and theres a slide out storage unit under each bed which you can put your things in and lock up,0
everything is very clean and i felt comfortable enough to walk around barefoot,1
absolutely love this place and wouldnt stay anywhere else if im in london again ,0
the very basic conditions were acceptable for the price but the incompetence of the staff was not,0
the receptionist told me incorrect opening times  which meant i was unable to retrieve my laptop and deposit fortunately an exemployee was around and came to the rescue and stuck inside the following morning,0
do not stay here if you want to stay out past 1030pm or leave before 930am,0
also you need your own padlock for the lockers,0
the bar downstairs is pretty cool and the hostel is super close to the train station and borough market ,0
would not recommend the 33 person room,0
has a sun roof so the room is always bright ,0
was not a fan of the triple bunks and the maze like set up of the hostel rooms,0
i had two beds booked,0
we cancelled the day before and they charged us over full price as a cancellation fee,0
absolutely terrible service,0
one of the best hostels ive stayed in world wide,0
not the cheapest but 1010 in every other department,0
so i suppose you get what you pay for,0
alex who works at reception is top bloke,0
excellent location,0
very clean room friendly staff,1
good atmosphere in the bar,0
a quality brand in hosteling that is falling short on some basics ,0
staff were really inconsistent at reception esp in terms of knowledge  care factor ,0
cleanliness overall was pretty good,1
however multiple toilets with no toilet paper 3 days in a row,1
on one occasion i was told by reception that there was no housekeeping form afternoon to next morning  reception would fix when they got time  it never happened ,0
so in terms of value for money  top  pound for this hostel should do better,0
consisting how spread out berlin is its right in the centre,0
so you can get to anywhere in reasonable time,0
the room was lovely but always a long wait for reception,0
fantastic hostel,0
clean washrooms and beds,1
hostel bar is open late for those who like partying but also not loud enough for the noise to bleed into the rooms if you want a good nights rest,0
beer pong pool great music and a live dj on weekends,0
cheap beer for london prices too,0
highly recommended for those who are solo traveling and looking to meet new people,0
generator was well equipped with nice beds rooms showers,0
had lockers for bags and plug ins and lights at each bed,0
location was out of the way nice and close to the metro though,0
good vibes but felt like more of a hotel than a hostel,0
i was here for a very short time but this place had a very good vibe,0
it was close to tokyo jr as well which was helpful,0
great hostel,0
definitely the largest hostel ive ever stayed in,0
quite far away from the main part of london but for the price thats expected,0
everything else was adequate,0
friendly staff and clean comfy bed,0
the toilet next to our room didnt have a sink,0
so i couldnt brush my teeth when i got back late as i didnt want to usr the sink in the room whilst people were sleeping ,0
breakfast was good and location is great for victoria station,0
i was traveling as a single female in my 20s and i felt very safe,0
our room was in the kitchen and it can be very noisy if some visitors dont care about yelling in the early morning while making coffee,0
beside that great area quiet but close to the action,0
dont be shy to walk aroud the block theres some nice cafÃ©s and a grocery,0
the room was a bit expensive but what aint in toronto seriously,0
good to know,0
 you have to pay with the card of the person who booked the room,0
stayed at a few other hostels in paris but nothing like this one,0
great staff atmosphere and location,0
location is very central but it is above a pub so if you cant sleep with noise then no,0
i spent my night here just to catch a train ,0
a couple of items or facilities were out of order during my stay ,0
staircase smelled like puke and packed bed linen piles waiting to be washed were visible everywhere ,1
squeaky beds,0
spent about 4 nights here and loved it so much rebooked it for the end of my trip,0
stayed in 3 different rooms while i was there,0
each room had at least a sink shower and toilet,0
some of them had these separate and some had an extra sink,0
super clean and rooms looked organized and nice,1
bar downstairs was great was a happy hour and overall awesome atmosphere to meet people,0
they provide towels as well,0
super close to tower hill stop on district line which was convenient,0
would stay again ,0
we will stay here again next time we visit berlin ,0
thank you for the experience,0
super close to public transport and cn towerentertainment district,0
lovely staff ,0
the room and facilities were mostly fine,0
the biggest drawback was the lack of privacy in the showers ,0
also the lack of fans in the hot summer months and the fact that you have to putremove your own sheets as well as pay for a towel,0
upon arrival the lady at the reception offered us a double room instead of a dorm for the same price,0
that was very friendly,0
the room and bathroom were quite small but had everything we needed,0
the bed was very comfortable and clean,1
breakfast was basic but sufficient since it was included in the price,0
bathrooms were disgusting and the breakfast area was a mess,1
showers were broken and clogged,1
air conditioning was ineffective,0
the sta was excellent,0
location is the biggest plus as its 5 minutes walk from gare du nord station and the staion has well cnnctivity across paris,0
it has round the clock reception and secure card entry to the room,0
absolutely nothing wrong with this place,0
atmosphere is so great beds are comfy and clean kitchen has everything you need breakfast is cheap and great night time activities are fun,1
parks surrounding the hostel easy to catch the tube into the city grocery store and great pubs very close by bathrooms were always clean really great crowd of people there and staff was so friendly and helpful,1
made some great friends and had an amazing time,0
great for solo travellers,0
thanks astor museum inn,0
first time ive seen such a wonderful group of people working together ,0
rooms are cleaned daily ,1
very good location ,0
amazing friendly staffs ,0
highly recommended to travelers looking for a good place to stay with such a wonderful atmosphere ,0
it was quiet a comfy hostel and the facilities were decent,0
the kitchen area is a great place to create some of your own food,0
the atmosphere was a bit odd but thats coming from my perspective so it may suit someone else,0
there were a lot of children there which i wasnt expecting,0
and i found it hard to socialise here,0
its a little bit out of the city centre however it can still be accessed by a train station nearby,0
overall a nice place to stay,0
the air conditioning is only in the lobby,0
this hostel gave my friend and i a horrible bed bug infestation,1
they refunded us one night while we were there but when we contacted them later informing them of the extent of the infestation and asking for more compensation they completely ignored us,1
we tried both emailing and facebook messaging in lieu of writing a bad review and were not responded to,0
if you want to stay at a clean hostel that will treat you with respect if something happens dont stay here,1
great central clean,1
i have never been in a hostel so dirty and i do not understand the good ratings,1
also there seems to be a lot of drug dealing going on right around the hostel which is not the hostels fault of course,0
our bathroom was dirty with lots of corners full of accumulated dirt and the mattresses were outright filthy with mattress and bed having a multitude of nasty stains,1
above the second mattress the one in the lower bed which was newer was very very thin,0
window could not be closed list goes on,0
very clean very nice staff and very good breakfast but the small rooms both bedrooms and common rooms uncomfortable beds and high price kind of ruin the experience ,1
also theres only 2 showers and 2 toilets per floor which means you might have to queue in the morning ,0
all in all we did enjoy the stay,0
and i especially appreciated the fact it was absolutely spotless but a few little improvements ie leave the game and breakfast rooms open add shelves next to the beds would help,1
i enjoyed my stay at rest up however the first night i was allocated the incorrect room meaning that i had to check out and store my luggage the next day,0
i was compensated with free continental breakfast and a towel but it didnt seem enough given the true inconvenience that was of no fault of my own,0
atmosphere was good however a lot of european high schoolers at the moment,0
fairly close to elephant and castle tube station but does require a 10 minute walk,0
the staff was super friendly and helpful ,0
best things were the location 3 blocks from a metro station and in front of hyde park and the full breakfast for Â£1 ,0
we liked the free blankets and soccer balls to take to the park and the gigant tv screen ,0
bad things were that the room was pretty small and crowded awfully hot 4th floor and that the bathroom was also too small with no ventilation ,0
however overall the value for money was ok and we would stay there again ,0
thank you,0
very clean place and a bathroom and kitchen was within the rooms which was nice and convenient,1
quiet location near several convenience stores and staff were very friendly,0
one problem was that there werent any elevators so be wary of having lots of luggage or heavy suitcases as was my case ,0
the main door and the room door were all opened by a padlock,0
wifi was very slow on my computer for some reason but was fine on my phone,0
security hear was okay with lockers although the location wasnt great,0
yes it was near the metro but the neighborhood itself felt more like algeria or tunisia vs paris,0
maybe a good place to try some north african food though,0
my main gripe was the staff who seemed more concerned about maintaining a cool hipster nonchalance and tending the bar rather than checking people in and taking care of the guests,0
also tried to trick me into buying breakfast that cost extra,0
bathroom reeked of feces,1
hostel have age limit,0
1 you cannot eat your own food or drink your own alcohol in this hostels bar,0
one of the staff told me not to drink my own alcohol there and perhaps enjoy it across the road instead,0
she told me that four times and added that i would be charged if i kept drinking my beer in the bar,0
i think hostel guests could enjoy their own food and alcohol even though they were not purchased at the inner bar ,0
2,0
no free luggage room,0
you have to pay to leave your baggage,0
during my visit it was 4 eurosday,0
i had a twin private room with my friend,0
clean room good shower towels and shampoo and hairdryer supplied ,0
rooftop bar excellent ,0
right next to a metro stop ,0
only criticism was not enough lockers to store bags on day of checkout,0
this hotel is not in downtown  which i didnt mind it because i came back to the airport next day  ,0
the stafff is friendly,0
i did check in 11 ish and i didnt have problem at all  ,0
about security  they didnt gave any keys and the room is unlocked ,0
for one night  was ok  because i went to bed and next day i left  ,0
i like ,0
it cause is like an apartment and you can feel more like,0
home also because it has a share kitchen ,0
an underwhelming hostel with such a snarky rude staff,0
i havent been in a hostel where the staff are so clueless about city suggestions eg transportation sightseeing booking etc,0
rooms are grimey and ac doesnt work,0
have fun sleeping in a musty room in 37100 degree heat,0
on top of this the area the hostel is in so confusing that no rickshaw or cab driver knows where it is so it adds a lot of effort in trying to get home,0
everything looks nice in the photos,0
but its so janky in reality,0
really clean big hostel,1
the rooms are spacious so you dont have to be on top of your roommates the whole time ,0
it was in a decent location however i felt it was just a tiny bit out of the center of things the rooftop bar was such a nice idea and was so lovely too sit out at night,0
however saying this the outside was shut at 10pm and although i understand this is due to neighbours it would have been nice if it stayed open longer,0
so you could enjoy the view ,0
right by the dlr line and offers breakfast ,0
the privacy curtains are great ,0
the bar can be a bit loud but the staff are great and the facilities are regularly cleaned,0
this hostel is awesome,0
the staff are so welcoming and accommodating and are happy to help with anything,0
overall pretty good hostel i would stay here again however not in the 12 bedroom dorm probably a smaller bed dorm due to having an extremely small room filled with 12 people and on the top bunk of a 3 bed bunk bed,0
location was great 5 minute walk to the london bridge,0
was relatively clean but the bathrooms could of been cleaned more often,1
it would be handy if there was a kitchen,0
we had an amazing time at unplan,0
the staff is so nice and the hostel is extremely clean,1
the cafe downstairs and rooftop are very nice places to hang out and meet people,0
the area around the hostel is amazing to walk around and to try new food,0
the subway is so close and easy to use,0
we loved staying here and hope to return soon,0
nice quiet hostel in a great location,0
carpet was a little dirty and shower wouldnt drain quickly,1
also it was very hot on the third level with poor air circulation and the fan did not work  however it was july during my visit,0
so im sure it would be fine other times of the year ,0
overall decent place to stay,0
staff was very friendly,0
i really enjoyed my stay in greenwich a very nice place to stay,0
the hostel was very clean bathrooms maintained and the staff were very helpful especially kinga and sophie in reception helped making checking in a breeze,1
the dorms were big and spacious,0
i booked this hotel due to its proximity to finsbury park where me and a friend were seeing a gig ,0
we arrived at the hotel and paid for the room were then told the key to the room was broken why they didnt have a spare key i have no idea,0
we were told to wait 15 minutes we assumed for a spare key to be brought to us but the employee had booked us a taxi and a room in a separate hotel in a not very friendly looking area 40 minutes walk away from the gig venue,0
bad experience very bad,0
best hostel ever,0
recommend to everyone,0
staff was great,0
showers were weird and wifi was horrible,0
overall not a horrible place but thought it was a little expensive for what it was,0
we stayed here for one night in july,0
we had a private double room,0
it was clean enough although not spotless,1
the bathroom was very basic but everything worked fine and we were grateful for the air conditioning ,0
we put our breakfast in the fridge and it was fine the next morning we never saw other guests ,0
the staff were very friendly although they speak little english and they let us store our suitcase on the day of checkout,0
good for a one night stay would feel cramped after a few days,0
incredibly hot location relatively far away and an especially small and cramped room relative to many ive stayed in through europe,0
staff was kind though,0
the staff was rude yelling at me to put my feet down off a couch and often times unreasonable,0
we had to switch rooms and couldnt check in or go into the room until 2pm meanwhile the next day the new guests were coming into our room from 810 waking us up and storing their luggage while we were still sleeping,0
dont even get me started with the showers and bathrooms,1
it was hard to find a clean shower as most were always filthy,1
waited 24hrs and still none were cleaned,1
one word unsanitary,1
great hostel spacious common area easy location to get around london right by the tube station and with buses headed to central,0
my only complaint would be that there were no cubbies that one could lock your valuables in in the dorm rooms,0
i had to move my stuff to my friends private room when we went out,0
emblem is a funny one it has everything about it that would be make it the perfect place however the location is just a little bit too inconvenient to stay at,0
it has incredible facilities and its very comfortable with very friendly staff however the location for me was not great,0
and i wouldve spent more money to stay at a place with slightly less quality if it meant staying nearer to the city centre,0
stayed one night the showers were small and sprayed your cloths and drain into a central channel so theres no dry space,0
the room had no air flow and windows can barley be opened woke up sweating,0
trains,0
the location is central but right next to trains so it makes for a challenging sleeping arrangement ,0
the lounge area is a bar so if you are looking for a spot to relax search elsewhere,0
the staff was great and helpful though,0
the breakfast was basic but included,0
the facilities need some updating but were always clean,1
a bit frustrating that the location was far away from everything,0
about half a mile walk from the closest metro,0
however the place was very nice and clean,1
huge lockers to store all my stuff,0
staff was alright but not super attentive,0
pros great neighborhood to stay at friendly staff very clean floors and bathroom nice rooftop water filter cons do it yourself breakfast can improve you are only allowed butter 2 eggs 2 pieces of toast and a drink the laundry machine keeps breaking so owners really should invest in a new machine beds can improve by adding a shelf and curtains overall great experience,1
friendly and easy going atmosphere,0
close to the subway for easy transfers,0
walking distance to good restaurants as well as to the top of the hill where you oversee everything,0
highly recommend to others,0
positives solid atmosphere decently clean really great showers,0
negatives no kitchen no air conditioning ,0
my room didnt even have a fan neighboring street is absurdly loud until like 5 am every night,0
good hostel for partying every night not so much for sleeping,0
had an amazing time here ,0
super clean awesome staff terrific bar  atmosphere ,0
if you are undecided dont be ,0
just book before it sells out ,0
will definitely come back here again,0
this is the cutest little hostel in a very nice area,0
staff is awesome and the atmosphere is really social,0
this was hands down the coolest hostel ive ever stayed in,0
i stayed on the floor where each room was painted by a local artist,0
the lounge is good to socialize from 530  630,0
stayed open until past 1 am to check us in after our flight was delayed,0
great location super friendly and very clean,1
plus amazing coffee,0
nice owl,0
especially to tadashi,0
we were really happy during our stay,0
you guys saved our life hihihihihihi eheheheheh,0
cleanliness and comfort could have been better but location was great and the pub was a nice spot to relax and meet new people,0
shoutout to peter for being helpful with directions,0
i was very very pleased with the facility,0
the staff was nice and helpful,0
even upgraded my room for me,0
they were attentive and very friendly,0
made my stay in toronto very enjoyable,0
plus to be downtown among everything for the price i paid,0
it was the best ,0
great for the price,0
was really good,0
the atmosphere was great and the location was fantastic for people using jr as it was a jr station only 3 minute walk ,0
cheap and cheerful,0
with easy access to the centre via public transport,0
the mixed dorms are simple and you get a varied mix of people staying for different reasons,0
in all a good budget option,0
my very first hostel as a solo traveler and i loved it,0
only stayed for two nights but it felt like home,0
i was sad to leave,0
the staff is so nice and the atmosphere is very bright and happy,0
will definitely come back and recommend to my friends,0
dustins guest house was an amazing place to stay ,0
excellent location just a stones throw from the subway station ,0
the staff was extremely friendly accommodating and very helpful and the facility was clean and comfortable ,0
i would definitely stay there again,0
cool environment helpful staff clean rooms,1
facility is central next to the museum island,0
recommended,0
hostel is a small nice andclean place with tatami mats and a cool japanese styled common room,0
beds are slightly hard though,0
kimchee was a great hostel,0
it has all the essentials  a hangout spot good location international people and drinkingsmoking spots ,0
i really enjoyed all the people i met there more than anything,0
happy customer,0
rooms were clean had decent privacy in your bunk and good storage for your bags,1
busy place especially for young people the bar could use an extra hand seemed to always be a 10 min line up for fooddrink,0
also only had 2 washer and dryers for the entire building which were always being used never had any luck washing clothes,0
the mens and womans washroom on our floor had only 1 working toilet during our stay,0
not sure what was up with that,0
probably wouldnt stay here again,0
great value for money with the place operating like a hotel but with dorms,0
very helpful staff and a good location too right next to glouster station,0
the staff even bought my ticket for the forbiden city on my request while i was at the great wall since it was getting sold out pretty quick d,0
amazing,0
if you want to feel right at home in the middle of berlin with both the people and the facilities then this is the hostel for you,0
this is truly the best hostel ive ever stayed at thanks to the extremely inviting staff and the comfortable atmosphere,0
within minutes of arriving i had new friends and each night looked forward to returning home to this quiet n cozy spot just off the main road,0
great place for solo travelers  clean and lovely common areas for chats,1
i love you u inn berlin,0
â¤,0
ï¸â¤ï¸,0
really good overall,0
made trips to sensoji and asakusa easily,0
also it is close to ameyoko,0
facilities were pretty good,0
there were showers on every floor which were nice,0
staff was super friendly,0
and ac everywhere,0
a really great hostel offered lots even a swimming pool but sauna not working doors very loud when closing and while there there was a huge group of teenagers that made a lot of noise right up until 11pm,0
would be good not to have smoking in the courtyard as the smoke goes straight up into the bedroom windows that open onto it,0
would go back anytime,0
didnt stay long and i was a bit under the weather but definitely into the curtains on the beds,0
definitely booking this place next time i come back to berlin,0
right in the middle of mitte close to just about everything and the rooms were very very good,0
everything about this place was perfect,0
the bunkbeds in the rooms were 3 beds on top of each other with a very unstable frame that wobbled and squeaked every time i rolled over,0
there were no screens in the windows i got a few bug bites and the showers smelled bad,1
the wifi only worked downstairs in the pub not in any of the rooms,0
the room i was in only had 3 lockers even though there were 6 beds in the room,0
i asked to rent a towel and they said they were out ,0
that being said it was a very good price and i didnt get bedbugs,1
just spent one night here wish we had booked our entire stay here,0
it was far better than our previous hostel,0
we were impressed with the charm this hostel had a very authentic french feel to it,0
our room had french doors that when opened gave a nice view into the street,0
this hostel is located close to a lot of trendy restaurants as well which made going out for a bite to eat very convenient,0
would definitely stay here again,0
great friendly place,0
everything was perfect ,0
a very nice staff ,0
i good location near the metro  ,0
but i found some bed chip ,0
put some product everywhere guys ,0
xx,0
no plugs by the beds one bathroom per room extra charge for sheets and when paying by card no atmosphere the bar is open to the public so anyone can walk in at whatever time,0
they want even into the hostel staff dont care or check when you walk in staff werent friendly or informative about anything when we asked ,0
location was okay stay here if you want to sleep not if you want to meet other travellers it was quite dead and we were there on a weekend mid august,0
super great location,0
the only issue we ran into was that there was only one bathroom for the 8 of us and some people are not as considerate about that and would spend way too much time in there,0
i have stayed in several hostels this summer and this stay was in my top two,0
really great place and value for money ,0
loved how it was very secure,0
nice place to make new friends and amazing night life at belushis ,0
booked a 10 bedall female dorm and got upgraded to a 4 bedall female,0
youd think this would be a good thing however it was the smallest room in the entire world,0
no more than 2 of us couldnt be off our beds at any given time,0
location was good though,0
we had a nice view of the pyramids,0
they said credit cards accepted but when we got there they only took cash ,0
fab hostel,0
its a bit far away from the main sites like shinjuku etc,0
but its only an 8 minute walk from kanda station where you can get around from really easily,0
showers are great with hot water all hours provided with a locker on arrival and theres even kitchen facilities for you to use,0
i only say the atmosphere was average because while we were there not much was going on  maybe it will be different at a different time of year,0
overall though great hostel and would definitely stay again,0
solid place for the price,0
would definitely stay again,0
loved it,0
will definitely be back,0
highly recommended ,0
never never ever stay here ,0
the loud music from disco downstairs make sleep impossible  until 200 am ,0
although they provide the earplugs and location is convinient nearby train station ,0
i guess for travellers all alike,0
 we need sleep,0
thus this is super important ,0
also the door access card was malfunction ,0
eventhough i extended the checkout to 100 pm the door access card was mulfunction,0
something wrong with the system,0
place is for staying during schools trips no entertainment for adults ,0
that rule about no food allowed to be brought into wasnt followed very strictly at least in july 2018 although bags have been checked every time at the entrance,0
no air conditioning makes it very very hot in the rooms hardly possible to have a refreshing sleep and no soap is provided at bathroomswc,0
this hostel has no working wifi no security lockers no sinks in the toilets very few power outlets in dorms no shower head in our shower and no kitchen area at all,0
i know paris is expensive and but a lot of these facilities could be provided with very minimal effort and cost,0
this is unacceptable considering how crazy expensive it is especially compared to most other european hostels which have all these things for a quarter of this price,0
the location is amazing but not worth it,0
staff is friendly and fun,0
building has enough social area,0
wifi works well,0
rooms are clean and secure,0
hostel gives ear plugs for free ,0
at first stayed at 8 bed dorm,0
it was very very noisy because of the street club outside and fan inside,0
later changed to 4 bed room  it was way cosier and comfortable ,0
breakfast food is good,0
but after breakfast the kitchen is closed for cleaning at least 2 hours and so when i woke up late i couldnt make my own breakfastbrunch,0
great atmosphere in the lounge area and good location but my room was hot at night the bunk bed above me creaked loudly and the outlet on my bed lamp was vertical so my plug kept falling out,0
all minor issues but still inconvenient,0
the hostel is old the walls inside the rooms are bare concrete which makes it feel even older,0
the facilities were clean no complaints there,1
overall an average hostel in a good location,0
check in line was laughably long  for hours ,0
bathrooms were disgusting water on the floors doors were broken general disregard for hygiene ,1
only 2 people to help with a huge line of people waiting to check in seriously got out of there as soon as i could ,0
room was fine,0
pretty nice place with a really good nice staff,0
rooms need fans and more plugs though,0
overall good place,0
would definitely recommend staff are really helpful can go extra step to help you out ,0
place is neat and clean ,1
good hostel,0
the staff talks in various languages,0
french english spanish  italian,0
this was great,0
the facilities are great everything is clean,1
the location of this hostel is perfect for tourists,0
just a brief walk away from some big attractions shopping  dining options and public transport including airport bus ,0
the dorms are not as modern as some hostels but i stayed here for a week and was perfectly comfortable ,0
staff are lovely and made you feel very welcome,0
wombat felt like home away from home,0
thank you so much,0
feels very warm and welcoming,0
really great hostel,0
right next to the metro,0
so you can reach paris city centre easily,0
the staff were all very friendly and we felt very safe for the whole of our trip,0
only stayed for one night and wished wed stayed longer,0
the rooms are well maintained and the bathrooms clean,1
the staff were very friendly and helpful and the bar at the bottoman of the building provided a great atmosphere for socialising,0
a little pricey but great value for money,0
i returned this year as a year ago my stay was very pleasant ,0
now the state of the bathrooms was below reasonable ,1
the shower tubs were chipped at best they were greasy if not dirty and with grey marks from not having been scrubbed in a while ,1
you dont want to forget  leave your flipflops ,1
i saw one of the matresses being changed  several stains in a wide array of colours and sizes ,1
the kitchen sinks were not far either ,0
too bad,0
this place was great but it now needs refurbishment ,0
a bit too loud and very hot no air conditioning and the windows dont open very wide,0
if you want to stay some place cheap in london then this might be the place for you,0
however i will warn you that it is very hot in the room you will be sleeping,0
there isnt any air flow,0
so if you cant sleep in a hot environment this place is not for you,0
curtains on the bunks and air conditioning what more could you ask for,0
i had an amazing time here,0
extremely social environment perfect place to meet other travelers,0
awesome party vibe,0
beatriz the adorable lady that host the daily event is amazing,0
she makes sure everyone has a great time,0
as a solo travelling aussie i met soooo many lovely people felt safe the entire time and had a blast,0
great location great atmosphere great staff,0
sandino worldimprovement network is an amazing place to stay,0
its not only a hostel its a community of openminded and amazing people,0
its my favorite place to stay in berlin,0
there is a herb garden and also 2 rescued chickens running around,0
location is perfect  20 minutes by tram to the city center but also close to the lakes local vibe,0
there are some restaurants around as well as few bakeries with delicious sweets and bread,0
we will definitely be back next summer,0
i got bit alive by dustmites i am literally covered,1
now i have to deal with being itchy for 11 hours of flying,1
i left at 5am i had enough,1
no mosquitoes in the room no bed begs,1
i thought i was losing my mind,0
but i started googling and yes dust mites dont techincally bite but it leaves you with a mark just like one,1
i really liked this place,0
but i am super upset about this,0
i had a great stay and loved my room,0
it should be noted that this particular hostel has more of the feeling of a hotel than a hostel,0
but none the less a neat spot in a cool area,0
the air conditioning in the room wasnt working during an extreme heat wave which made it almost impossible to sleep,0
after complaining at the reception multiple times nothing happen despite claims that theyre gonna fix it the same day,0
after complaining a fourth time and threatening to leave we were finally offered another room with working air conditioning,0
the location of the hostel is great located between two main train stations you can get anywhere by metro or train,0
great location lovely proprietor clean but a wee bit shabby ,0
would go back,0
this was a great hostel,0
the beds were comfy we were lucky to have a 4 bed ensuite to ourselves,0
staff super friendly and helpful,0
under bed lockers were great and convenient,0
only down side was the shower was covered in hair but staff at reception were helpful to get it sorted for us by the time we got back in the evening,1
had a great stay on a thursday night,0
place was buzzing with people from everywhere,0
i was traveling with my three friends,0
so we got a room for the four of us had an entire room with a bathroomhalf shower,0
it was on the third floor of the building and i know it is the summer but the room got so hot that one friend had to leave the room because of hot flashes,0
it was a cool night outside but no fresh air got in,0
third floor 301,0
less a hostel and more just a place to sleep,0
they had a few vending machines in the building which was nice and it was clean,1
the locker is more of a closet so theres lots of space,0
not really any social atmosphere,0
but maybe i just came at a slow time,0
simply the best,0
while the location of this property is quite nice the hostel itself did not meet expectations,0
my bed which has been made up for my arrival had two pairs of womens underwear in the sheets,0
the bathrooms were filthy,1
the furniture was worn out and most looked damaged,0
and the breakfast had a poor selection,0
however the food at the bar on the ground floor was good with decent prices,0
i would not stay here again,0
good location for clubbing slightly out of the centre for tourist stuff ,0
clean showers and bathrooms but a lack of changing facilities no where to put clothes when in shower ,1
atmosphere not amazing but a bar with 2 for 1 cocktails ,0
squeaky beds ,0
overall good,0
i want to go again,0
great hostel great facilities amazing staff ,0
recommended,0
came from a night out 7 in the morning,0
slept couple of hours to check out for 10 so dont even know much what to say âœŒðŸ»,0
ive honestly never given this low of a rating to any place and its for one reason cleanliness,1
or the lack thereof,0
my sheets were threadbare could see through them my duvet was yellowed and had some other persons hair on it,1
my room was so dusty i woke up having a sneezing attack and the showers were just disgusting,1
the couches in the common room were also cracked old and kind of gross,1
the staff did their best to help but it just was so unnecessarily dirty on so many surfaces ,1
the hostel was great,0
guests kitchen was really handy,0
the bar downstairs was awesome different event each day beer pong tournament was the best part,0
the beds were set out so we all felt comfortable and safe,0
this is the first and only time i stay at a hostel in canada so i cant comment if planet traveler lives to the expectation of best hostel in canada ,0
i have stayed at hostels in europe and asia and i could easily recall some better hostel experience ,0
being spontaneous is one of the beauty of staying at a hostel ,0
i could get my needs met without the help from a staff at most hostels i have stayed at but not this one,0
very nice place,0
the rooms were very clean and staff were friendly and helpful,1
would of loved a fan in the room as it got very hot with 6 people in a small room and no air con,0
other than that would definitely stay here again,0
great location,0
other than that theres not much of note to say about my stay,0
it was your standard hostel dorm room,0
the staff were a bit rude and the beds were uncomfortable,0
we really enjoyed our stay,0
wonderful hostel great location friendly staff and excellent breakfast,0
place was nice and cheap,0
toilet and shower facilities are good beds are nice and comfy,0
room is very hot but still worth it for the cheap price,0
loved staying here,0
the library bar is the perfect place to get to know others and start the evening,0
they have some kind of event going on each night,0
the pub crawl list was full but i tagged along anyway and paid as i went,0
had a blast,0
love the staff the building itself was old style but rennovated with up to date and clean accommodations,1
the breakfast had eggs which was nicer than others but still nothing amazing,0
it is a little walk from city center but theres a transit station close by,0
bed bugs and when i tried to tell the lady who worked there about it she refused to believe me because they had sprayed it recently,1
 if so apparently not well,0
i even caught one and took a picture,0
and she still wouldnt do anything about it,0
they didnt change the sheets between guests sometimes either,1
i wanted my money back but the lady wouldnt hear of it,0
this was a nightmare experience,0
if you book and you get room 11 just leave,0
amazing price location and friendly staff,0
checked in at 3am and they had no problem with it would recommed 100,0
i had read previous reviews and knew that this place is nothing flash,0
all i wanted was a decent nights sleep,0
but that wasnt happening with a rave going on downstairs until 4am,0
and it really does stink of old cigarettes ,1
the girl working behind the desk the next morning was lovely though and did her best to keep guests happy,0
location was convenient in that it was near a main train station but it was rather sketchy as two girls we felt uncomfortable being outside during the day,0
staff was averagefriendly and the common areas were clean,1
the bathroom in the room was unpleasant,1
shower was moldy toilet was visibly unclean,1
double charged my credit card shortly after booking,0
i havent heard back yet about fixing it but it is the weekend,0
very good staff but very small and cramped up rooms,0
very little value for money in terms of room space,0
literally no air to breathe,0
it had a great atmosphere and vibe to the place very welcoming for people traveling,0
the location was very ideal as t was close to he metro and not too touristy meaning it wasnt overly expensive,0
overall great place,0
great hostel excellent staff,0
a little further from the main areas but very close to a metro line  definitely get a metrocard if youre staying more than a few days,0
we slept past breakfast time every day whoopsie but we did a walking tour of the spice market and sikh temple and also a lotus temple and food tour later on  do the tours,0
theyre the best,0
hostel cleaned every day,1
but maybe they need to empty the ladies toilet bins more  not done once and after 4 days they were very full,1
in terms of location and staff this place is great in the heart of shoreditch and the staff are super friendly and super helpful,0
the cleanliness of the hostel is what really lets it down,1
it doesnt really feel like anything is cleaned properly a lot of dust on the floors the bathrooms are varying degrees of cleanliness but none are very clean,1
bathrooms are terrible outside the room and very tiny,0
didnt expect the area where it was but all the sense of awareness and confusion gone off once i found the hostel,0
the security is pretty much good dorm ac is only active during the night time or maybe when requested sadly the day i went the ac in my dorm was working with least efficiency and the wifi was not working the next day inspite of these,0
i gave a good review since i didnt spent my time on internet or sleeping off common spaces were interactive and ambient in short it was awesome ,0
great place lovely staff and even comes with a cat named jesus ðŸ‘ would stay again,0
really lovely staff in a brilliant location,0
very basic but for the price cant complain at all,0
private rooms are very clean but showerstoilets could be better,1
make sure you check windows are shut at night as its on a very busy road and the builders outside kept opening ours,0
the area that citan was located in was close to a metro stop but the area itself was very suburban  there werent many sites or markets within walking distance,0
the staff was very kind and the beds were comfy and cute,0
the lounge area was super cool,0
the lockers were too small to fit a luggage,0
lovely staff good location right next to a station so within under 20minutes you can be in the centre,0
the rooms are comfy what you would expect from a hostel,0
the common area is great a nice atmosphere good for meeting other travellers,0
would stay again,0
wombats was great,0
the dorms were super clean and bright and the bathrooms were crazy nice for a hostel,0
the location was great for the tower of london but a little bit further away from soho and oxford circus but it wasnt a problem as the tube was only a 5 minute walk away,0
no aircon,0
but thats pretty standard for london and leaving the windows open at night helped,0
pretty decent price for what we got especially for london,0
would stay again ,0
i stayed for three nights,0
the first two had issue with toilet keep flushing whole night hard to get sleep because of the sound,0
the first day was too hot and the room was sultry with only one small fan,0
lift cant be use in first two days,0
the second floor environment smell moldy third floor was better after changing room,1
ground floor is a bar quite noisy at night especially when world cup won,0
staffs all super friendly and willing to help but the toilet kept broken not their fault tho,0
lovely staff nice clean rooms,1
no complaints ,0
amazing hostel its just a bit noisy during the nights,0
stayed here 3 years ago maybe its the time of year july vs november but the atmosphere has changed,0
its a party hostel,0
mostly groups of young brits and australians,0
the facilities are pretty basic for the price,0
although the location is awesome,0
stayed in a cramped 8 bed mixed room for 3 nights,0
there are no lockers in rooms and poor ventilation in both the rooms and common areas,0
showers have a very inconvenient layout so that only 1 person on that floor can shower at a time,0
also lots of stairs so if you have heavy luggage be aware of this,0
free breakfast is always a bonus,0
wifi is horrible though,0
it is slow and will cut out all the time,0
used eduroam for wifi during our stay as the wifi was not usable,0
nice staff close to underground great bar and lounge music all night at reception didnt prevent me from good sleep on first floor small beds but perfect for travelers,0
fantastic hostel with great kitchen great rooms friendly staff cozy lounge and a kickass garden,0
bar in the reception so no need to go far away for beer happy hour every night,0
not a party hostel though but a great place to meet fellow travelers and have interesting discussions,0
the area around the hostel is really sweet so dont spend all your time in the city centre,0
close to trams and metro lidl store bars and everything you can ask for,0
fan in each room to combat the heat,0
i had a wonderful stay at unplan,0
the staff were extremely friendly helpful and hardworking people that do their best to ensure you have a good visit to tokyo,0
i couldnt ask for anything more,0
thanks for everything,0
this is by far the most disgusting hostel i have ever stayed at and ive travelled a lot ,1
the building is absolutely filthy and the back hallway entrance to the hostel stinks like urine ,1
the bathrooms themselves were filthy as well with urine all over the floor as well as water from the showers ,1
the two toilets in the main floor bathroom did not work for the entirety of my stay and were often filled with vomit and over flowing ,1
the bathroom has the largest nest of cobwebs ive ever seen,1
pretty good hostel overall,0
great location for places to eat as its on a main intersection with lots of restaurants and food however the street can be very noisy in the rooms ar night,0
the location was also perfect as it was in between the city center and the more northern part of tow with mauer park,0
would stay again,0
mateeeeeee,0
worst hostel in the world,0
dont put yourself through that horror,0
trust me,0
i had an amazing time here,0
the staff was super friendly and very helpful,0
the area is beautiful with a ton of great places to eat or take just sit and read a book,0
it was very close to the metro and the breakfast was very good for only 4â‚¬,0
the have something be standing security all day which makes you feel extra safe too,0
the only issue i ran into was the hairdryer near my bathroom didnt work,0
and it was a little hot at night but i still cannot wait to come back,0
this hostel was one of the most comfortable ive stayed in,0
the dorm room was small but the bed was very good and the ensuite shower had reliable hot water and good pressure,0
the provided breakfast was more than you could want and the kitchen space was very useful,0
close to a main train line making it very easy to reach any part of the city and return to the hostel at any time of day,0
not that clean not enough bathrooms and not feeling safe ,1
the beds are good and the people are nice,0
staff couldnt do more to help me,0
fantastic location,0
best hostel in toronto,0
if someone has no problems with staying with strangers in one room then the hotel should not cause problems,0
easy access due to the proximity of public transport,0
fab place for the money you get a very soft bed we would say bring your own cup plates and cutlery as there is not a lot in the kitchen  ,0
the showers are loo sink shower all in one and there 3 for the ladies only and 3 for the men there are men only in basement and there was 2 showers on our floor that was shower only  ,0
we sat out in landing and every one was lovely ,0
around 10 room are people that live there  ,0
looks like a old office block on the outside but ok for what we payed,0
great location cant get any better,0
staff was nice,0
common area was pretty social,0
no free breakfast wifi was weak ac was weak,0
needs updating,0
tried checking in two different times and nobody was there,0
was ok,0
nothing special,0
slightly out of the way and i wish they had laundry facilities ,0
otherwise great ,0
clean comfortable ac is a huge plus in the summer fairly modern,1
definitely a good vibe,0
nice roomy lockers,0
they also have a shuttle service and a free walking tour and the staff are very helpful and friendly in general,0
the rooms seem to be all underground with no natural light and airfresheners concealing some unpleasant odours,1
however the room was clean and the facilities are fine for a few nights stay,1
good valie for money for the location,0
the location is nice and the people are friendly,0
the showers on the top floor are very nice,0
however the rest of the bathrooms are closetlike and perpetually wet and a little smelly as a result of their size and age,1
the downstairs hangout area is lovely until someone drops a penboils the kettleopens their mouthmakes literally any noise at which point it becomes a headacheinducing echo chamber,0
a fantastic failure of architectural design,0
the wifi was hardly working down there either,0
i absolutely loved my stay at hostel,0
bedgasm  its the place to be,0
its so clean and the beds are dreamy it was my comfiest nights sleep in so long,1
the location is a little out the way,0
but you can reach all the main places in about 45 mins walking and on the train and its quite nice to come back to a quieter area,0
the staff literally make this hostel they are so lovely and helpful,0
stay here,0
perfect location but quite expensive and noisy one night the bar kept us awake until 23 in the morning,0
my husband and i liked the place even though there was some arrogance attitude from the spanish male receptionist when we asked where we should go to find the sitting room and other areas,0
but really loved the italian smile girl that changed the energy of the place ,0
the toilet on our level 1 of them was out of service so we had to go another level to find a free one as on our own area,0
it was quite busy ,0
apart from that nice people and atmosphere ,0
thanks anyway for the service,0
i think the best part about this hostel was the great social atmosphere and planned activities,0
it made it really easy to meet and hangout with new people as a solo traveler ,0
the downside however would be the unfinished remodel of the bathroom nd the cleanliness of the dorm room,1
but otherwise the location is good situated in a relatively quiet neighborhood serviced by the northern line and a couple bus routes,0
the staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful for everything,0
great overall experience,0
bedbugs,1
right on my pillow crawling,1
i went to the desk asking what could be done and they moved me and another guy who had gotten bitten already,1
i had to go through my bag and clothes and once i was in the new room it also took me a long time to sleep and even when i did i always woke up since i feared there might be bedbugs there as well,1
i tried talking to the receptionist but they kept on pushing me off and telling me to email,0
i have emailed several times but they never responded,0
nice hostal although a bit far from the city centre and all the tourist attractions,0
not that much of a party atmosphere but you can definitely meet some nice people there,0
we shared a room with 2 more people and noticed our shower was clogged so they upgraded us to a private room with a shower which was great,1
only downside is no air conditioning but you can manage without it,0
took 1 hour to check in staff had no idea what he was doing just stood there for an hour waiting ,0
rooms very hard to find ,0
showers terrible highest water pressure every would reccomend if you want the skin off your back to be peeled off ,0
besides that room was good and a bar downstairs helped,0
best hostel ever,0
perfect stay meet ma y nice people at the hostel sammy and youness and all staff were so kind and friendly,0
didnt want to leave good job guys definitly will sray here again,0
great family atmosphere which is helped by the really chill staff,0
the dinners each night are a nice addition and make it very easy to meet others to go out with afterwards if youre up for it,0
unlike pretty much every other hostel in london there are no creepy old dudes,0
so its the place to be if youre looking for a laff,0
the location is great its near the train station,0
the place is utterly clean and very quiet despite there being many guests at that time ,1
the staff was very helpful and patient,0
i had to call several times for me to find the place yet they remained patient with me ,0
should i find myself in tokyo again ill definitely stay here,0
the rooms are clean and the breakfast is good but maybe you can find better things outside,1
the design of the hostel is cool and the private rooms are quite big,0
the bar is open til 230,0
too far from town even though it is by the metro station,0
wouldnt say it was how they described the area of paris,0
clean and tidy hostel though ,1
nice hostel with great amenities,0
i recommend renting a bike they are nice quality and a great way to get around the city,0
my favourite hostel central to everywhere in london,0
nice hostelilove the ambianceand,0
itsclean,1
staff are so friendly and helpful,0
wifi is,0
goodand,0
the aircon is working so goodnice breakfast tooi will go back for sure,0
i didnt had the chance to made to the hostel my flight got delayed and i spent the night at the airport,0
the place was super clean and pretty,1
minimal but had everything we needed,0
we booked a private room for 2 with bunk beds and it was tiny we barely had space to put our luggage,0
but we survived,0
overall good experience the staff was friendly and we wish we couldve stayed longer,0
thanks ,0
it was okay,0
not bad for a short 3 nights getaway,0
propertyatmosphere seemed dark  scary  hostel seemed old but the bed was cleaned well when i checked in as well as comfortable ,1
location wise good,0
its near to hyde park to walk to the very central of london or tube zone 1 ,0
tips make sure to bring locks for your luggage because other guests during my stay didnt seem trustable,0
also make sure to keep the Â£10 key deposit receipt to claim it back when you check out ,0
content with my stay here however would look for another place if i were to be in paris again,0
toilets and bathrooms are cleaned often which is a good sign,1
some staff members do not know much of the area,0
so its hard to get recommendations,0
tips from them,0
location is pretty far out from the main sights in paris,0
generally have to take a 30 minute journey to get in to the city centre,0
stayed in both the apartments and dorm room,0
the location made travel through the rest of berlin very convenient,0
it was also very quiet which made it a very comfortable and relaxed atmosphere ,0
for myself there were only two issues that i had with the eastener hostel,0
first was the lack of electrical outlets available in rooms making it difficult to charge phones,0
second were the showertoilet facilities which were somewhat small and not well ventilated ,0
otherwise great would stay again,0
had a great time staying here,0
i traveled alone and felt completely safe,0
the location was close to an underground station which made traveling around the city easy,0
the staff was very nice and gave wonderful suggestions for places to visit or places to eat,0
it was a nice place that i could either have a bit of quiet time to myself when i needed it and could socialize with the other guest when i wanted to,0
great experience for my first hostel,0
good hostel with a pro active staff helping you out with all your needs,0
moreover they keep the place as clean as possible,1
i arrived a little late and it felt a little sketchy walking from the underground,0
but its not far and feels loads safer to cross to the other side right outside the station,0
otherwise the whole experience was wonderful,0
i was here during the heat wave of 2018 and while other places had been unprepared for the heat i was surprised and sooooo grateful that they had our room stocked with two oscillating stand fans and personal bed fans,0
i love the bedside tables and the privacy curtains,0
the restaurant and bar in this hostel are great and serve as a nice place to meet other travellers,0
accommodation wise the dorms are set up nicely the beds could be a bit more comfortable,0
but hey its a hostel,0
overall no complaints,0
i was generally very unimpressed by this outdated hostel,0
there was mold covering the ceiling of one of the shower rooms ,1
the dorm i was staying in got really hot and the street noise and smoke coming up from the pub downstairs was bothersome,0
i was staying in a womans only room and one morning when i woke up around 9930,0
there was a man standing in the middle of the room changing over the beds ,0
not a huge issue but at first glance kind of creepy ,0
great hostel the nightly pub crawls were awesome,0
probably the nicest hostel ive stayed in,0
i was in a 6 bed female dorm,0
we had a private toilet room and private shower room and an additional sink,0
our room was cleaned everyday and everything was very nice ,0
the basement bar is huge with lots of games it was very good,0
huge kitchen to cook your own food,0
staff was all very friendly and helpful,0
no complaints,0
clean facilities and overall nice staff,1
location is amazing and the vibe is young and exciting ,0
guys from the bar could be nicer,0
andor faster,0
waiting long for an average to expensive beer doesnt seems very interesting and i even went somewhere else in one the evenings because of that,0
room was very smelly and hot i know weve had amazing weather in england lately,0
and we dont have air con but i was on the very top bunk and barely slept so hot ,0
room smelt like other peoples sweat not the best,1
i feel this would be better in winter ,0
staff lovely facilities great just a smelly and sweaty room,1
was a good stay and had a prime location,0
 getting an upper bunk was not great as having to go often at night made it a chore getting up and down as well as fumbling in the dark not wanting to put a light on so not to disturb others then having to wake early especially with a couple of others still having a conversation when you really want to sleep,0
again  pacing and repacking in the dark wasnt helpful also losing sunglasses in their case not being able to see it fall out while it was dark,0
loss of them made stay costly,0
i stayed here 4 years previously different name,0
it was interesting to see that the cleanliness or lack of hadnt changed,0
the cost of the private rooms had gone up and yet poor quality stayed the same,0
the unisex toilets were filthy and smelt badly of urine ,1
free breakfast is always good the staff were lovely and the showers were of a good temp and good pressure,0
had i stayed in a dorm,0
i wouldnt have mind the cost cleanliness,1
you pay for what you get,0
not great for a private room,0
parking was fairly easy ,0
hotel staff were very friendly and gave good recommendations,0
the cleaner stole 20 euros from me and the showers are tiny,0
a laurel building making it a nightmare to come and go around a very basic and tight squeeze room that two people bump into each other no provision of ac or even fans for the heat wave that struck berlin a construction site noise made the experience unbearable i wouldnt stay there again,0
the place is beautiful,0
my biggest issue is that im confident there is a bed bug issue there that isnt being handled,1
when i checked into my room it had a pungent smell i checked my sheets and the mattress and i saw a bed bug,1
i went to grab my phone take a picture of it but the bug went away,1
i checked google reviews of the hostel and the staff response to this issue was deplorable,0
i wasnt in the mood to argue or anything,0
so i just checked out the same day,0
great location and staff was extremely warm and helpful,0
would definitely stay again,0
lekkerurlaub is a wonderful hostel in an ideal location in kreuzberg,0
kathrin is an absolutely wonderful host whos on hand if you need any help directions to local areas and makes a delicious breakfast every morning,0
the hostel itself is clean and homey perfectly situated for exploring cafes and markets in kreuzberg and neukÃ¶lln and highly accessible via ubahn,1
i always felt very well taken care of and couldnt have asked for a better stay,0
very expensive 42euro pp in shared room ,0
no toiletries,0
no fans available with summer temperatures of 9899 towels very thin and rough considering the size of the hostel they should be able to offer a wider and healthier range of eatingdrinking options the shared spaces were drab and dark the quiet rules were not enforced very noisy outside the window after 10pm staff especially breakfast staff were not polite or pleasant ,0
but i do realize the hostel is not geared to travellers like me ,0
e ,0
this is my go to when in berlin,0
the location is a little out the way from downtown berlin,0
but theres a s and u,0
station less than a 5 minute walk,0
one of the best hostels ive ever stayed in and would never stay anywhere else in berlin,0
good hostel in a quiet area of ueno in tokyo,0
staff is friendly the room was clean showers and sinks were clean albeit a bit small,1
will stay at again the next time im in tokyo,0
i am glad that i found this hostel,0
the place was clean and comfortable,1
i booked a cruise tour with the hostel and i am pretty satisfied with the tour especially the quality of the food at the cruise and the room was nice too,0
location and grand wall tour were good,0
youll meet great people but social atmosphere is not great,0
most people go opposite hostel at 365 inn ,0
staff arent friendly  hotel manager or elderly night manager is rude and arrogant,0
many people found this,0
younger staff are friendlier ,0
hostel is extremely dirty,1
bugs and insects in shower,1
dirty floors,1
shower curtains are gross ,1
one day we went into the toilet in late morning and one toilet was covered in st from the night before,1
my friend and i stayed at this hostel for 3 nights and it was our first hostel,0
we absolutely loved everything about it,0
the staff and everyone staying at the hostel were incredibly friendly and it is so easy to make friends,0
there are nice simple breakfast options for cheap and there is a free social dinner every night at 8pm,0
we really couldnt have stayed at a better hostel to start our trip,0
the location people and activities and awesome and we wish we couldnt stayed longer,0
i loved this hostel,0
it was a bit pricey but worth it,0
the beds were comfortable and the atmosphere was wonderful,0
they had a bar downstairs but i couldnt hear anything from my room the floor above when i was trying to sleep,0
the bathrooms and showers were also very nice,0
this hostel almost felt more like a hotel than a hostel,0
also beware that there is an extra charge for linens and cleaning,0
close to center  showers are next to each others so you are showering acutely and opened to the bathroom any one enter will infront of you  bad atmosphere,0
and its very crowded  at night its very hot at the room which i couldnt tolerate  not recommended,0
great friendly staff,0
prime location directly across from natural history museum less than 5 minute walk to the v  a and an easy stroll to hyde park,0
a 20 minute walk to harriss or a short tube ride and only 2 blocks to the stop for the circle district and piccadilly lines,0
the area is quiet at night,0
the place was very clean and had ample bathroom facilities,1
will stay here again,0
the location is great and the place is very clean with enough toilet facilities that you dont have to wait,1
though like a lot of hostels the staff look like theyd rather be anywhere else and the breakfast is a miserable cop out of nothing more than toast cereal and some dirty diah water they labled as coffee,0
the key card lockers in the room also did not work,0
do not bother,0
rude staff and bed bugs lots of bed bugs,1
i was in the room for about ten minutes until i saw them all over the wall and floor next to the bed,1
one night is not worth 2 months of fumigating and parasites diseases,1
just awesful,0
good location from the metro station,0
breakfast was good and breakfast staff were nice,0
theres a weird smell when you walk up the stairs like a dead rat,1
the shower wasnt draining or was draining very slowly that i had to shower in ankle deep of someone elses used water,1
this hostel was just amazing,0
the location was perfect right outside the train station,0
as in metres from the entrance,0
you can walk to most places in about 2030 mins but,0
right next to be station if youd rather get a metro ,0
it was more like a hotel than a hostel,0
the beds were comfy the room was a nice size the walls made sure other guests couldnt be heard so nice and quiet ,0
highly recommended for all ages and durations of stay,0
there was nothing necessarily wrong with this hostel but there were quite a few things not right either,0
the air conditioning wasnt big enough to reach the whole room,0
so it was very hot,0
my bed was the only one without a curtain so with others coming and going there was little privacy,0
my reading light didnt work,0
the kitchen seemed to either be closed every time i wanted to use it eg evening or not enough room,0
the reception and kitchen are in a different building to most rooms,0
i dont usually have anything bad to say about hostels that are so cheep but this was like staying in an abandoned building and i dont mean that because of lack of people,0
it smelt so bad i gagged every time i entered the kitchen or bathroom or common area the ac in the room made a disturbingly loud noise every 20 minutes throughout the night the staff blatantly ignored people waiting to check in at the counter while they watched from the smoking room,1
you cant use the washrooms between 112,0
excellent,0
i use palmers lodge every time i have to go to london,0
it is extremely good value and no trouble at all in any aspect,0
always recommend it,0
pros good location safe nice kitchen,0
free towels provided ,0
cons no soap in dispenser,0
bed dirty upon arrival ,1
waste basket full,1
loved this hostel,0
upon arrival staff are super welcoming and helpful with questions and suggestions,0
the whole vibe of the place is great and i felt super safe there the whole time ,0
i was super impressed with the cleanliness and the facilities available ,0
its a little tiny bit out of the way of the city centre,0
but its super easy to get the tube bus or taxi to the main hub,0
i would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to everyone,0
great place to stay staff were friendly and helpful,0
very nice facilities,0
had a nice time at this hostel,0
great atmosphere with an amazing bar and good priced food available,0
the rooms were good enough room,0
the showers were disgusting,1
very dirty,1
otherwise a great stay,0
also would benefit with a better kitchen area too,0
really good set up hostel ,0
close to station and food ,0
and the berlin wall is at the end of the block 1 negative there is no power points next to bed,0
my stay at lazy fox has definitely been exceeding my expectations,0
the attention and the friendliness of the team the great location of the hostel its cleanliness and practicability the easiness with which you meet new people everything made my stay fantastic,1
im definitely gonna come back there when staying in seoul,0
would recommend for sure,0
the bed was literally wood,0
most uncomfortable nights sleep ever ,0
we got there at 9pm and told our sheets werent dry and will be ready in 2030 mins after checking back multiple times and being told they still werent dry,0
 we ended up just taking the dry sheets off of the line as the staff had left the property ,0
location is easy to find however its not near anything unless you use the tram ,0
walls are paper thin so unless you use earplugs good luck sleeping ,0
the hostle was nice outside but inside the room it was less atracting,0
we orderd a standart twin room with a window,0
but when we got where there we find outt hat there was no view thoght the window just a very close wall thus there was no fresh air as well,0
that kind of details is inportent to as and we were disappointed and oppset about it ,0
when we ask from the reseption for a nother room it felt as if we are asking to much ,0
he startet to argue that there is on problem and got offended,0
the atmosphere is dire the staff give off an air that they dont care you have to pay for a towel and for bowls to eat out of ,0
the door to my room could only open a quarter of the way meaning every time someone wanted to come in with bags they got stuck,0
this is a fire hazard ,0
the whole hostel has the feel of a ck den with shady characters and less than adequate ventilation,0
i wouldnt stay here again if you paid me,0
good parts  nice common areas  nice neighbourhood  people staying are generally of a decent calibre the bad  standards have increased over time and not providing a chargerlight for every bed is an endemic issue until they renovate all their hostels  old building stairs only across 5 levels  staff seem to be suffering a case of burnout enthusiasm for the job about as british as you can get  tied to the above cleanliness wrt to bathrooms also an issue,0
overall i had a very pleasant stay here,0
the location is perfect  within walking distance of all the main tourist spots,0
the public transport links are excellent and it was super easy to get to from tegel airport,0
i stayed in a single room which had everything i needed apart from a safe,0
the bed was very uncomfortable and the room got hot at night,0
but it was fine for my needs,0
staff were really friendly and helpful even when i locked myself out,0
would definitely stay again,0
great hostel in notting hill walking distance to undergrounds and really friendly helpful staff,0
new shower room and bathrooms always clean and tidy as well as the room and bed itself,1
thank you,0
really good hostel ,0
would definitely stay again just 5 minutes from earls court underground station which has 3 lines,0
you can easily get to the city center ,0
the hostel was great,0
good atmosphere nice staff and breakfast good ,0
such a great hostel,0
really nicely made bunks with good facilities,0
modern bathrooms and nice kitchen area,0
also a lovely backyard,0
friendly helpful staff and overall one of the best hostels ive stayed in worldwide,0
staff were friendly professional and couldnt ask for more ,0
the location is right next to an elevated train night with trains going past every hour of the night,0
noise from the street including police is very distracting and loud,0
the location otherwise is great ,0
the pub downstairs while nice is filled with locals at night which isnt great for solo travellers looking to meet other travellers ,0
beds were very uncomfortable and were sagging so much you could feel the supports underneath,0
great hostel with a dope atmosphere,0
hostel workers are really accommodating and let me check in a few hours earlier so i could sleep since i wasnt feeling well,0
would 100 come back here again,0
nice and clean room,1
friendly stuff,0
this is my 2nd time staying here,0
and i really enjoy it,0
the location is fabulous,0
i love being near hyde park and you can easily cross over it to get to bayswater and oxford,0
as well the neighbourhood the hostel is in is in itself a great neighbourhood,0
i love that the hostel is on the picadilly underground line which goes directly to heathrow airport,0
only negatives 1 no plug for your phone by your bed,0
have to plug it in at a communal area of the room,0
2,0
hard mattresses and thin pillows,0
location was okay,0
close enough to the train to get to major monuments,0
the rooms and bathrooms were filthy and extremely hot,1
no fan was available,0
most of the staff was very friendly and helpful however there was one staff member in particular that was so rude,0
it was making most of my stay uncomfortable,0
i was unable to get a clean towel or toilet paper for the room one day,1
she stated she would check on it but never did any thing to help,0
terrible experience overall,0
rooms were adequate we had a 6 bed mixed dorm located in central beijing with its own bar out front,0
good tours from the hostel and they could assist with most inquirys ,0
wet room ensuite was a bit grubby only because it didnt drain well after use and the floor was left with chest hair daily grub and soap on the floor,1
all it needs is a squeegy for the users to mop up with afterwards,0
also a mat outside would be good,0
so you dont slip on the marble floor in the rooms with wet feet,0
great hostel for my first trip to berlin,0
the room i stayed in a private apartment was spacious and very clean,0
it was nice to have access to lockers after checking out,0
the large locker was big enough to hold 2 45 liter backpacks with some extra space,0
plus it was easy to extend my stay when i had scheduling issues with the trains,0
location right next to an ubahn station was also a nice bonus,0
i would stay here again and recommend to others,0
rooms are cramped nowhere to put bags and only tiny lockers,0
there were bags of dumped clothes that sat in the room for my entire stay even though i notified staff several times,1
beds were so rickety that it was a core workout not to have the top bunk swaying,0
dinners were great staff were very friendly and kind kitchen was great,0
however the night activities were variations of never have i ever which really brings out the creeps and felt forced,0
not very comfortable in the summer heat,0
great location friendly bar atmosphere for meeting people with a free drink and cleansafe space within walking distance to downtownpublic transit,1
would recommend,0
this was an excellent hostel,0
i had previously stayed at another hostel while in berlin had a bad experience then chose to move to this one,0
everything ran smoothly,0
the staff had great customer service and were awesome in helping me out,0
the facilities themselves were very impressive locker with electronic key included and clean,1
immediately made friends which was definitely a plus,0
highly recommend staying here,0
its very nice,0
staff were friendly facilities were clean and good  only thing is the garden wasnt open and i was looking forward to that  overall a really nice and clean hostel i felt safe and people were respectful ,1
good stay,0
the keycard didnt function at first had to walk all the way back down to get it fixed,0
when i did get into the room i was disappointed by how horribly cramped the room was,0
all the beds were right next to each other so it felt like we were all sleeping in one big bed,0
not every bed had their own electricity socket and light,0
the showers were terrible and the pipes were leaking all over,0
they were really clamped as well,0
there was no place to leave your stuff or to undress,0
overall good location and really good communal areas,0
there were a few downsides our room was below the barclub,0
so it was loud all night and very hard to sleep,0
there was only a couple of sockets in a room for 8 and no mirror but a sink which was handy,0
the staff were sometimes fine but not the friendliest,0
because of the location it was good overall but it was probably too expensive for what we got especially given the room being darktoo loud to sleep with a wall right outside the window,0
el xcellent,0
positives double room was spacious and well equipped cable tv ensuite good value for delhi,0
dogs are adorable,0
location handy for trainmetro station and good restaurantsstreet food although not much to do nearby ,0
negatives lack of cleanliness common facilities and friendly staff gives the hostel a bad atmosphere,1
bathrooms needed to be cleaner especially the one used by staff in the common area which was disgusting,1
however still good value for money overall,0
its the shittiest place ive ever been,1
in every aspect ,0
unorganized unfriendly not clean ,1
i had to move every day from one room to another because they couldnt figure out their own system ,0
at the second day i came to my room and all my stuff was gone,0
they took all my stuff and put it away in the basement ,0
i had to get my stuff and go to another room which was already full,0
then they sent me to another room which was full as well and the male staff member waked the four girls at 2am,0
i had a fantastic time at the astor inn,0
staff was very helpful and were on top of everything,0
the dinners and hostel events were well attended and a great way to meet people,0
i made many friends and everyone was very welcoming ,0
only complaint is that it was hot and there was no ac which is common for london there was only one fan per room,0
maybe try to pick up a small fan of your own and you should be fine ,0
overall awesome location and an awesome time,0
easy to get to hostel close to some local sites including the moulin rouge staff very friendly rooms basic but clean,1
only annoying thing is you cant use the kitchen in the morning as they supply a breakfast deal,0
hostel was more like a hotel,0
no outside food or drinks aloud,0
requires you to eat at the cafe in the hotel,0
kitchen had to shut down due to not having the ability to keep up with orders,0
check in took two hours past when check in was promised due yo over whelming amount of people and bus load of high school players comming in,0
the washroom facilities broke half way thru my wash,0
the staff was on point in helping and refunding my money ,0
222nd hostel stay and i must say not a good experience,0
the room was on the street so it was noisey,0
but cool at night ,0
no air conditioning ,0
staff was friendly ,0
it had an elevator,0
the walk to the eiffel tower is about a 1520 minute walk which is still convenient but not as close as it was described,0
some of the staff was extremely rude yelling at people to finish breakfast just minutes after the serving period had ended and refusing to acknowledgehelp anyone who didnt speak french,0
facilities are not cleaned daily,1
they were never cleaned during our stay,1
floors bathrooms and walls were disgusting,1
also they will find everything possible to charge you on,0
it was amazing,0
it is more like a bar with some rooms on it ,0
lots of locals at the bar everyday makes it difficult to meet other travellers,0
pub food and beer specials are good,0
good social atmosphere just difficult to meet other travellers,0
yes its loud but if you are looking for parties and good time this shouldnt bother you,0
nice staff but disappointed needs improvement,0
good hostel in quite area with nice common area good bathroom facilities and nice beds,0
nice hostel with great bar,0
staff wasnt amazing but pretty good,0
only conplaint is the wifi does not work in the rooms and only in the lobbyand even then its pretty bad,0
the downstairs is amazing the interior design is so cool the area is also good for drinks in the evening,0
the atmosphere is really good with a lot of people about,0
the room was quite spacious however the only fault is the toilets shower arent great to be honest compared to other hostels ive been for the same price,0
would definitely stay again,0
a great place too sleep,0
you are at a distance from the main sites but the underground station is near by so you would want to get a day ticket if you want to see,0
also the roof top bar is amazing with a great value meal for 45â‚¬,0
i stayed at both st christophers in paris,0
and i think the other one had a better location,0
but this one had a better bar and the rooms were nicer,0
i only stayed here for 1 night but everything was amazing and in retrospect i wish i had stayed longer,0
its pleasant to stay at hip hop hostel,0
will recommend friends,0
no toilest on the second floor too loud to sleep if your room is above the bar the staff sometimes was uncooperative and rude,0
all perfect apart from that the 23 man dorm can get quite crowded,0
great staff excellent location 5 min walk to the london eye ,0
great food and guests get a 15 discount ,0
thanks for having us ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€ðŸ˜€,0
great atmosphere lovely staff,0
awesome location in montmartre which is the best neighborhood to stay in,0
a bit noisy since there are construction workers right outside but the place is clean the atmosphere is nice and the location is amazing,1
bed bugs in beds in our first night,1
lockers were really skinny so backpack wouldnt fit in it small day bag would though,0
backpack also didnt fit under bed so had to find somewhere to put it without crowding the room which was hard,0
bedsheets had to be paid for and you get a base sheet top sheet and pillowcase,0
no donna cover ,0
included breakfast was good the upstairs terrace was nice ,0
location was close to s  u stops,0
stayed there for 3 nights good value and clean,0
nice asian food places around,0
the staff were such genuinely nice people,0
although the downstairs area isnt super condusive to social interactions i ended up meeting some really great people,0
the dorm gives you a ton of privacy and th facilities are great,0
awesome hostel,0
common area is dirty and has workers sleeping on the floor during the night,1
ac in bedroom didnt work,0
didnt provide a water fountain to refill drink bottles this is fairly standard in good hostels in india,0
surrounding area is unpleasant,0
this 46 rating would be even lower if the location wasnt so good but it is a good location near hyde park,0
pros great location nice staff clean showers nice breakfast with sausage bacon two eggs baked beans and 4 slices of toast,0
cons,0
no wi fi in the rooms no fans no screens on the windows mosquitos,0
no lockers in the rooms,0
unacceptable,0
this is not 2007,0
a guy in my room first time in a hostel had his expensive camera and new apple laptop stolen,0
management could do nothing,0
fine place for a short stay,0
rooms were very hot and slightly overcrowded lockers needed,0
the room was much smaller than expected and the drawer spaces that each bed had were tiny,0
the room was also incredibly hot,0
if youre looking for a younger more lively atmosphere i would not stay here but if youre just passing through it is well priced and the location is very good,0
shops and places to eat close,0
other guests were nice but this hostel was weird doesnt look as nice as the photos inc,0
communal areas,0
no soap or place to hang your stuff for shower in communal bathroom,0
vender empty no juice at breakfast usually standard,0
never seen so much water on bathroom floors in a hostel before,0
fan broken in room so was really hot at night,0
keycard repeatedly kept not working,0
no inroom storage,0
ok it you want somewhere to stay cheap,0
but i wouldnt stay again,0
some staff werent super friendly and the rooms were so hot,0
no fans or air movement whatsoever,0
so we had to sleep with our door wide open,0
very secure hostel though with great lockers and key system,0
common areas were very groovy and good atmosphere,0
average,0
nothing great or bad,0
theres better places in tokyo for less or same rate,0
excellent hostel  very friendly staff fridge so you can store food rooftop that you can go sit on,0
hard to find when youre in the area entrance is poorly signposted look for a door that says comebackpackers on it but great value for money,0
lidl about 5 minute walk away,0
everything perfect minus atmosphere,0
wish there was a free breakfast,0
but it is japan,0
would 100 stay again,0
there is something wrong with the shower one moment cold and the next second boiling that borng you and i visit in summer so can not take a nice shower the showers very tide and uncomfortable,0
the beds are nice i could spleep well and the people in the reception is very kind,0
if youre staying here during the summer expect uncomfortably warm rooms,0
no ac,0
generator is an old standby for stays in berlin whether in summer or winter ,0
recently i was refused accommodation during some big sport events but this past week i had three nights which allowed me to visit friends and continue to explore berlin and the outskirts ,0
i finally got back to potsdam and san souci after many years ,0
go to the zillestube and have a bowl of soljanka in the nikolai viertel,0
the location is on the canal which is nice its right next to district 19,0
a friend,0
and i got chased from the time we got off of the metro at crimÃ©e to the hostel,0
we got chased by 9 guys,0
they were running at us yelling i want to fk you come here bch,0
when the manager overheard the next morning she blew it off as they were flirting,0
i had 4 other women tell me that they had a time they felt unsafe as well,0
there is a security guard posted there 247 because they need one in that area,0
definetely the best in berlin,0
only stayed one night but my experience was lovely,0
the staff were great,0
right near the train station and close to supermarkets,0
would definitely recommend this hostel and would definitely stay again ,0
thank you,0
clean and cheap place,1
has a very modern fill and everything fills new and fresh ,0
downside is the area,0
it does fill horrible and a slightly rough area,0
the tube is near though which is convenient,0
we stayed in a 4 bed mixed dorm,0
lockers were a good size bathrooms were ok but not the best,0
location was quite far from the centre but was right near all the restaurants and bars,0
really nice atmosphere especially in the evening,0
the staff were very cheery helpful and positive,0
room was clean,1
awesome free breakfast in the morning with heaps of variety,0
late night music didnt bother me no problem for heavy sleepers in my opinion,0
couldnt be more perfectly situated to access the borough markets and the london bridge tube station,0
would recommend,0
only downside is not a backpackers feel downstairs because it is a pub,0
as a solo traveller i found it tricky to mingle,0
much better than my other london hostel experience,0
good location and decent breakfast,0
however there are no social activity,0
my boyfriend and i are both very sociable people and we often make lots of friends while traveling,0
but the atmosphere of the hostel is quite isolated,0
everyone hangout with people they already know,0
no one really make any new friends ,0
also very noisy,0
if you are a light sleeper like me you might have trouble falling asleep with the loud music and drunk people screaming right below you,0
but the staffs were helpful,0
very hot hostel,0
the travel desk will try to sell you very expensive excursions and trips to other cities saying they are good deals,0
he also scared us about the trains showing us horrific photos which arent true so we would spend more on a taxi,0
however if you get a taxi ask for sanjay as he is the best one,0
he will take you anywhere and is so friendly ,0
they have 2 cute pugs but allow them to poo on the tiled floor so watch your step,0
great,0
loved the deluxe room on the terrace,0
loved the air con even more,0
only really stayed for a night due to last minute change of plans ,0
cozy atmosphere and approachable staff ,0
i just feel as though the dorms were a little cramped and somehow i managed to get mosquito bites at night,0
staff are very friendly and helpful,0
i arrived quite early before check in and they let me put my bag in their locked luggage storage before i could check in,0
the nightly free dinner is a great way to save some money but also to meet people in the hostel and start playing games and group up for a night out,0
i would definitely stay here again,0
beds are a little tiny but its a cool place to stay,0
in general it is a good place to stay well located,0
bathrooms were so small you can barely move inside it,0
the service were so bad,0
i have to wait about one hour and half to make the check in,0
they didnt want to give me a towel and i waited almost two hours to get one,0
after i left my room they throw the towel in the floor,0
it was a bad service,0
if you want to stay only to sleep and take a shower maybe worth it,0
spacious converted townhouse spacious and calm,0
a little rough around the edges,0
the hostel had a lot of activities and a great laundry service,0
the happy hour at the bar was great and the staff was friendly and helpful,0
its very good value for money and is perfect for getting out about close to some nice restaurants as well overall a nice place to stay,0
good hostel friendly and cool staff,0
location is good,0
was a bit quite though,0
excellent location,0
if you have a japan rail pass the metro to this hostel will be included ,0
using the metro youre fast at tokyo station from where you can reach all desired locations,0
you may even walk to tokyo station ,0
the hostel itself is a classic hostel with all you need but no special additional things,0
if you sleep in a bed on a upper level the ac might blow into your cabin so avoid this,0
the beds have enoght room for your luggage,0
first time staying in a hostel really happy,0
i stayed at astor museum,0
met really nice cool people helpful staff and clean bathrooms,0
i had a very good experience at sunflower hostel we arrived late at night  but it was not a problem since reception is 247,0
even more so one can get a relaxing drink and chill at the entry area of the hostel,0
the location is just perfect  one can get some midnight food just 5 minutes away from the hostel,0
its located around 6 minutes away from one of the main stations where you can get a direct train to the airport,0
would definitely come again,0
had a pretty good stay here,0
the common room is really nice and a good place to meet people if youre traveling alone,0
rooms and bathrooms were clean,1
i wouldnt say its the best location because its a 15 minute walk from ueno station which is on the central line,0
you can change lines and catch the subway which is very close to the hostel but its much easier if youre close to a station on the central line,0
its also double the price of some hostels in the asakabashi area right near akihabara,0
great stay,0
only issue is they do not have a kitchen for you to makestore your own meals,0
also dont do their 20 euro trip to versailles,0
it saves maybe 30 minutes in travel time,0
you can get round trip train tickets for 750 euro,0
i love this hostel and i will be returning very soon,0
best area to just chill out and have a beer amazing for meeting other people can recommend to solo travellers,0
rooms and showers arent anything special but everything elses makes up for it,0
good value for money comfy beds,0
theres a bar outside which is great  it isnt noisy at night ,0
tram line and underground nearby allowing easy access to everything,0
i had a great stay at hostel one camden,0
staff were super friendly and they always have loads of social activities going on to make you feel welcome,0
for example when i returned to the hostel after my gig i was invited out with some staff  other people staying there so we hit a bar just down the road in camden,0
i didnt want to go to bed straight after the gig so it was perfect,0
just make sure you bring your own padlock to use on the lockers or youll need to buy one when you arrive,0
its a really convenient location the line its on takes you to many major places in london and its also next to many bus routes,0
when i came back in the evening i was somewhat worried about the noise from the bar but none of it reached to the hostel itself and other guests respected others sleeping,0
itd be nice if they offered a way to lock the lockers usually hostels use keys,0
guests seemed to use their own padlocks ,0
the hallway on the second floor smelled very weird sometimes ,1
also if you dont already it would be nice if all door handles get sanitized since a lot of people use them ,0
the breakfast bread was really hard to chew,0
and i wish breakfast can go on until 11am since sometimes people are really tired from staying out late the night before ,0
other than that i had a really nice stay i would recommend it,0
good location in the middle of the city,0
catch a taxi right out front no waiting ,0
three computers and tv to use in the lounge area,0
free wifi and breakfast from 7 am to 1 pm ,0
each dorm has a bathroom with shower plus an extra bathroom next door,0
daily activities and a rooftop social area,0
laundry facilities and storage area,0
lots of space for eating and fridges to use,0
staff friendly and informative,0
phones available,0
key card gives you 24 hrs access and staff is there 7 am to 12 ammidnight,0
everything is perfect location is a little wary if youre a female walking on your own at night but apart from that worth every single penny,0
joeys hostel was my first stop in india and i could not be more thankful to have found this place,0
the staff are so welcoming and genuinely enjoy spending their time with their guests ,0
all of the accommodations were clean and anything i needed towels clean water lock for my locker etc was accessible to me at all times,1
i am so happy with my stay at joeys and will absolutely stay here again if i find myself traveling through new delhi again,0
would highly recommend hiring a bike from reception to allow you to get around berlin easily however the public transport system is easy and cheap also,0
staff werent the most friendly people in the world and didnt really have any desire to help us,0
hostel however is clean and tidy rooms were extremely hot as there is no air conditioning,1
good for a quick stay,0
overall very satisfied for my stay there,0
convenient  safe location friendly staff comfortable homey atmosphere,0
almost gave it a 10 except that id like to draw their attention to almost 13 of the chairs in the resting hall,0
they are in so such old shabby broken condition that nobody wants to sit on them,0
their condition also makes them look dirty,0
its a shame they are there in an otherwise very welcoming well laid out  well thought out hall,0
this place is nice if youre just looking for a cheap place to stay inside the city,0
the breakfast was really small and nothing special you have to leave your room for some hours during the afternoon the wifi also doesnt work the whole time and the number of showers isnt enough for the number of guests,0
the stuff was really stressed when i arrived but all in all friendly,0
the receptionist was extremely kind and helped us change rooms when we found out we accidentally booked a single person room rather than a twin,0
the rule is two people have to sleep in a twin room with two beds,0
the bed was extremely comfortable though ,0
the lock was kind of annoying to get used to because it locked every time the door opened and closed no matter what,0
great security but stressful if you leave it in your room while showering ,0
overall a great experience,0
one of the best hostels ive stayed in,0
the room was really clean and the location was good,1
i also liked the curtains around the beds,0
i would absolutely recommend staying here,0
great place to stay if you want the be in the centre of old delhi,0
the hostel is definitely well located very close to everything,0
i liked the staff since they were very friendly all the time the facilities too are great,0
the hostel made me want to return even more to london,0
got placed in a room of 9 when i booked a room for 6,0
room itself has only 2 power sockets to provide charging opportunites for 9 guests,0
my bed was taken during the day while i was out even though it was clearly occupied staff not very sympathetic,0
only worthwhile thing about the hostel is its proximity to a train station,0
brilliant clean and safe,1
usually i try to stay in places with female dorms but this time i went mixed,0
and i still felt safe,0
the showers and toilets were the best and cleanest i have ever seen in a hostel,1
highly recommend this particular one and its chains if they are the same,0
really fun time here,0
couldnt be more central  youll only have to use public transport if you want to go out of the centre of the city,0
friendly and helpful staff and everything seemed clean enough,1
as mentioned before the showers were slightly annoying but basically fine,0
perfect location and lovely hosts,0
tried too hard to have fun,0
if you like manufactured entertainment  hostel ones are your place,0
it was ok but couldve been cleaner and the hostel lacked a good atmosphere but the location was really good,1
it is very close to metro station ,0
room was cleanand they give u clean towel everydayplus they even make bed for you everyday,1
well its rare to find that kind of luxury in a hostel ,0
they have got a standard,0
the place is really really good,0
from the moment i entered i was received with the utmost attention and care,0
everything is clean hallways and pods,1
pods are also very comfortable inside a little small in terms of room size but having that privacy of a pod was reassuring for me,0
they have lockers as well under the pods to store the bags and things you want to leave behind,0
bathrooms are also clean and the rooftop has a beautiful view as well as a lovely vibe,1
in summary well worth it,0
all in all a decent hostel with a very cosy bar in a really good location,0
i was really unhappy with the lack of vegetarian options for food though especially for breakfast,0
i had a great stay at st christophers berlin,0
they cater for every kind of traveler and when coming to a new city you want to be sure that you can rely on your hostel to have the right combination of comfort atmosphere and facilities,0
heath the bar manager was great and went out of his way to make sure that i had a great time in such an awesome city,0
cheers mate,0
will visit again soon,0
stay for a night at this hostel and it was okay and nice stay,0
the atmosphere is awesome really easy to meet new people,0
the staff were heaps friendly and helpful,0
the bar is amazing great place for food or to drink,0
kush at reception is very polite and helps people,0
saksham is also very helpful,0
it is a good hostel not many bathrooms and showers but a great atmosphere the pub downstairs is good has nice discounts to guesses and the waitress kerstin was an absolute legend took good care of us provided great service and gave us good tips for london,0
this hostel is fantastic,0
very clean and comfy rooms and clean wellmaintained bathrooms,1
the staff are super friendly,0
its a great home away from home located in one of my favourite neighbourhoods in tokyo steps from sensoji and all sorts of lovely restaurants and markets,0
i would stay here again in a heartbeat,0
staff is great but the blanket and pillow is never washed,1
they give us sheets to put on top,0
it smells and all they do is spray couple times and thats it,1
had to sleep in smelly blanket and pillow,1
it was very nice clean place,1
the manager was very helpful kind and resourceful,0
she helped us in transportation and other activities,0
our room was very nice and clean,1
we got free towels everyday and room service,0
the location was great very close to the bus stop and the underground,0
if i go to paris i will use it again and i will recommend to others,0
although the location is not necessarily ideal it is a 2 minute walk away from the jubliee and metropolitan lines which can get you to wherever you need to go,0
the staff were all lovely helpful and fun shoutout to tom,0
the facilities all worked perfectly and the world cup game was always on in the hostel bar,0
definitely a good time and would reccomend,0
nice place with very good atmosphere and lovely staff although bathrooms were really quite disgusting and the showers sucked,1
it was perfect for what i needed,0
located near the subway station and hongdae but in a calmer area it feels really safe at any time of the day or night ,0
this hostel doesnt have a bar but is a twin of the party one so if you want to go out with people you can go there and meet a ton of cool people to have fun with ,0
its pretty small a dozen guests i would say and the atmosphere cozy so its easy to approach people ,0
the staff was super friendly and helpful ,0
the only downside was the lack of storage space in the dorm,0
great value for money and in a good location a quiet area in walking distance of a tube station to reach central london easily,0
i stayed in a 4 bed dorm which was very comfortable and the bed was ready made unlike many hostels ive stayed in,0
i liked the keycard lockers and free breakfast too,0
it is quite basic as can be expected with the price  but perfect if you just want a cheap to stay,0
would come back again,0
the other reviewers stated there is a strong feet smell at the front entrance which is true but other than that it was a nice last minute stay,1
it was very close to the subway station and we felt safe the whole time,0
requested and confirmed room with 2 beds for 2 people was not there,0
that is we got one queen bed for 2 people,0
this guesthouse is exactly what i needed at this time,0
i felt like i was living in my own apartment with a few roommates,0
extremely clean quiet full kitchen great wifi and very friendly,1
i felt so comfortable,0
great place to stay and very good value,0
great place if youre travelling alone met unreal people here,0
joeys hostel in delhi felt like home,0
i ended up staying waaaaay longer than planned just because it was super fun,0
rooftop,0
it is incredible chill loved it,0
hostel it is clean and bed comfortable,1
the staff it is awesome,0
specially josh super friendly and helpful,0
great street food market in the area and well connected with subway,0
def recommend this place for your stay in delhi,0
i miss joeys so much ,0
a great place to stay and good value,0
the towells and sheets they gave were really clean and that is much appreciated,1
suggestion a blowdryer in the bathrooms would be much appreciated,0
i like the way there is plenty of coffee and tea,0
i have no complaints about this place at all,0
however the staff should know about cabs the phone numbers of a local and reliable cab service etc,0
that is not uber or any other fool cab like service that is totally unreliable,0
my sister and i arrived 6 hours early for check in time after being on the train overnight for 16 hours,0
our lack of sleep led us to ask if it was possible to check in early and rest,0
the lady at the desk was very kind and was able to switch things around so we could ,0
the room was very clean and comfortable  the location of the hostel was perfect,1
if you couldnt walk to where you wanted you could take the ubahn or ride the very affordable bikes,0
the breakfast was also very yummy,0
we got top bunks that were so close to the ceiling it was so difficult to climb up and get into bed and impossible to sit up in,0
there was no air conditioning and the bathrooms were super small,0
the staff was indifferent except for one person,0
there was so common area to relax and stretch out in,0
the rooms themselves barely had any room to walk around and no space for each person to put there luggage except on the already small beds,0
the lockers are only small one that cant even fit backpacks,0
good location nice staff and free breakfast,0
its the best hostal ive stayed in,0
dont buy a lock before coming here,0
locker locks oversized in the room you have to buy one of their massive locks for one off use,0
good location pretty clean rooms kitchen not in the best condition but everything works,1
however very good price for a room in london and good location if youre on a night out that side of town,0
very clean and quiet hostel,1
definitely not a party vibe as advertised,0
the staff and general atmosphere of the hostel were good but the facilities could have been better the locker system is difficult to use and expensive the lift didnt work and the rooms were incredibly hot at night,0
we were only here for one night,0
but i probably wouldnt rush to stay again,0
had a really enjoyable stay,0
it felt like i was staying with family,0
the owner dj would make us soft boiled eggs for many of the mornings,0
robert the manager was a really cool fella and we had some great talks during the stay,0
i loved the location and the property was really kept well,0
highly recommend,0
i really enjoyed my stay,0
i had a private room with a friend and we were on the top floor,0
location is great near the british museum and the staff at astor are really helpful,0
emblem is great,0
the people are amazing the area is very social and the facilities are great ,0
the location isnt great as its far,0
but once you realise that most places take 3060 mins to get around then you dont worry about the location ,0
thank you so much emblem,0
i chose this hostel for its location next to the hauptbahnhof,0
very easy to find,0
they did seem under staffed though,0
the luggage room system could be revamped but other than that i had a fine time,0
i would stay here again,0
fine time at the hostel but another traveler  i booked a tour to luxor  aswan that was a big scam,0
long story short sent us to the wrong city so missed 1 of 4 days of tour refused to partially refund for missed day said single occupancy on boat when actually double manager yelled at me called me a liar said i was blackmailing them for saying id write a review here threatened to cancel whole tour if i didnt write a good review etc,0
terrible  stressful  overpriced at 400usdperson,0
good hostel but no fans or air conditioning wouldnt stay here again in summer,0
me and my friends stayed here for 3 nights and we literally had the best time,0
all the staff are super friendly and the hostel is in such a good location to everything in berlin,0
would definitely go back here,0
staff very rude on arrival and throughout stay,0
rooms very noisy from traffic,0
showers were not individual so didnt use them and did not appear to be cleaned regularly,1
also some locks on toilet doors were broken,0
had to pay to store luggage,0
overall would not visit again and would not recommend,0
great place for meeting fun people from all over,0
staff are awesome too,0
great hostel,0
the staff was friendly and i liked the style of the facilities,0
it was a good hostel for a short time in my case 2 nights,0
rooms were quite small but fine and the shower was fine but not the cleanest,1
it wasnt terrible but it wasnt great either,0
we had a very enjoyable stay here,0
when we had a problem the staff were very helpful in resolving it,0
the kitchen is large and the hostel is near a supermarket and multiple train stations ,0
we had a private room which was tiny but wouldve been bareable if we had a functioning curtain,0
our room looked out into a courtyard which had a curved building with loads of windows which meant everyone was able to see straight into our room as if we were in a zoo,0
we had to get changed in the dark or take it in turns to hold the shitty excuse for a curtain up,0
oh and lets not forget the generic american dude playing guitar with his mates 247 which really added to the hostel experience,0
ðŸ˜‚,0
nice place in a quiet neighborhood just a short walk from the train and a market with a ton of food options,0
i have no complaints and would stay again,0
baggies angel was a wonderful place for a short stay,0
upon arrival youll get your keys entry to the hostel only the doors are unlocked sheetspillow cases and a nice little tour of the place,0
in the 12 person room i stayed beds were super comfortable and roommates quiet  clean,0
the only reservation i have is the beds can be creaky and tend to move if you move disturbing everyone in your 3person bunk,0
other than that a lovely stay,0
really enjoyed this hostel,0
great kitchen great rooftop bar 6bed dorm was spacious and the mattress and pillow very comfortable,0
clean and secure,1
only complaint was the wifi quality barely worked in the room and was also not the greatest in the downstairs common area sometimes fine and sometimes wouldnt load at all,0
also appreciated them printing documents,0
the hostel was great,0
i didnt mind the 3 minute walk to the metro,0
the beds had curtains which was great for privacy,0
the room did get pretty hot at night though it was july,0
the bar at the entrance is great to have a drink or a snack at and there is a great atmosphere when everyone is hanging out at the end of the day,0
for the price this is a great option for exploring paris,0
really good and friendly staff,0
no aircon in the rooms made it hard to sleep on the hot summer nights ,0
other than that good stay,0
nice place very clean and well maintained,1
excellent location ,0
it is truly a party hostel  very recommended ,0
really great basic hostel,0
a bit far out but really quick to get to the centre by tram,0
great standard for the price,0
only issue was that the room was really hot ,0
this is a great place to stay if you want to be close to tokyo but dont want to pay an arm and a leg to stay in the city itself,0
kawaguchi station is just a short train ride out of central tokyo and tokyo is so big that you will likely need to take a train to get around anyways,0
the hostel space and the rooms were very comfortable  i especially appreciated the ac in the hot weather,0
extraordinarily clean in a brilliant location and cheap  what more can i say,1
first time to egypt had an amazing stay,0
air conditioning decent wifi cheap food and water with a perfect balconyrooftop view of the pyramids,0
thomas is a great guy and runs an awesome hostel,0
i really enjoyed the vibe and reception i received in emblem hostel nishiarai in tokyo japan,0
when we checked in a receptionist was very welcoming and nice,0
he even asked me asked how i was doing in tagalog my native language which surprised me,0
he also kindly invited and encouraged us to join them to watch the fireworks during our stay there,0
lastly i really appreciate his help in assisting me during my call to an onsen place in hakune to inquire about my lost wallet,0
i got it back ,0
i loved sakura,0
it was an amazing first time experience of a hostel,0
everyone was nice and comforting when i really needed it after hours of being lost and having a 16 hour flight from america,0
i dont usually do reviews but for sakura it was a must,0
please keep up the good work and positive energy,0
great breakfast  good location ,0
difficult to meet people,0
super helpful and accommodating staff,0
great facilities,0
had a fab stay at planet traveller,0
really friendly staff and guests,0
worth the higher price as breakfast is extensive and facilities are greathostel is extremely clean,1
thank you for such a great stay,0
decent hostel,0
cleans rooms beds already made a nice touch clean bathrooms albeit small and very easy to reach via tube,1
only docked for lack of plugs and lights by the beds,0
people have devices to charge and its unnerving to leave them out in the open away from you while youre sleeping,0
this is a party hostel,0
people are at the bar until 1  2am,0
good place to meet people,0
if you want quiet this is not the hostel for you,0
my luggage cage was broken so i couldnt lock my things in my hostel room but the staff gave me free storage in the paid lockers in the basement,0
the broken locker never got fixed but it wasnt too inconvenient,0
the paid lockers are also pretty cheap if you want to lock your belongings up more securely,0
staff is really nice,0
location is very good,0
but they dont know what hygiene is,1
its fairly city center but great hostel to meet other people and also beds were quite comfortable i really liked the pillows ,0
only downside was the bed frames themselves arent that great and creak and squeak a lot ,0
brekky is love and shout out to duncan and tom for the lovely conversations and warm welcomes â¤,0
ï¸,0
had a amazing time,0
could not fault anything,0
bus stop right outside,0
shoppe and take away 2 min walk,0
tube 5min walk,0
clean,1
staff very helpful and happy,0
we didnt realize when we booked that some backpackers live here some for a year or more,0
when we got to our room there was stuff everywhere,0
clothes suitcases the girl on the top bunk above us had clothes falling down to the floor all night,0
the common room areas are used by the people living there and there was no real comraderie around being new to a city,0
we were woken up on our last night by some um bed shaking above us,0
but it was cheap,0
the staff were incredibly rude,0
would not stay here again,0
the hostel is very nice big the beds were comfyhappy hour â‚¬2 beers,0
thats pretty great,0
it isnt in the city center but who really cares when you have easily accessible transportation,0
my only complaint was the lack of fans,0
you cant go weeks in the midst of a heatwave without them but this was a problem everywhere in germany,0
my advice amazon,0
it is true that stores are sold out because i tried to buy one in dresden where i stayed for the summer,0
very clean and everyone was really nice and helpful ,1
lots of nightlife and stuff to do nearby in the area,0
everything is in perfect condition,0
amazing hostel always intereting and friendly people at the bar down stairs plus cheap beer to get the conversation flowing,0
thursday night karaoke was a highlight of the trip,0
definitely one of the best hostels ive been to with friendly and knowledgeable staff,0
only down side is its all rather hot theres no aircon or fans anywhere in the building,0
great location ,0
if you dont do a shared room you will probably get a roombathroom outside of the main backpackers,0
we found it super safe and fine ,0
rooms were small but cant say we were in them a lot ,0
ac needed some tlc ,0
super close to the city,0
and you have parking out the back for 10 which was handy ,0
only one washing machinedryer so make sure you pre book ,0
not the best,0
but its cheap and close to a metro,0
clean and cheap,1
nevertheless a bit ugly and outdated,0
staff is wonderful,0
nothing is really wrong but not amazing either,0
would not go there again for the facilities but would repeat for the staff,0
cant explain how kind they were,0
overall my experience at grand hostel berlin classis was great,0
the staff was always super helpful and fun to be around and helped to create good vibes in the hostel,0
the primary drawback that i found was with the facilities particularly the toiletsshowers,0
there werent really enough toilets for the amount of people staying on a floor and the communal showers lacked any kind of pressuretemperature control on 3 out of the 5 occasions i used them,0
it was a bit frustrating,0
good hostel would stay again,0
nice hostel staff were friendly,0
we had a 4 bedroom dorm which was great as we were a 4 person group,0
so we had our own space and a private bathroom,0
room was clean,0
great experience,0
nice staff perfect location super clean,1
loved it ,0
i enjoyed my stay at the hostel,0
it was a good location close to montmatre and a walk to the river,0
it got a bit loud for sleep with the bar downstairs,0
the room was clean and the facilities good,1
good hostel for a cheap price relatevly easy to reach and close to a beautiful park and nice neighbourhoods,0
i wish they can clean the bathroom frequently and make not to leave dirty waters and dishes lay around,1
i know its india,0
really expensive place to sleep for what it offers,0
small room with a regular bed in an old building in a bad state,0
difficult to sleep if you can get annoyed with a machine sound,0
not sure about what it was something like a big electric generator constantly running on,0
room that feels old shared bathroom without any possible lock and as it is inside a pub at night you are there on your own alone with the rest of the guest no reception,0
it is just ok for a quick sleep and get out of there,0
we booked a one night stay for 2 people,0
when we went to our assigned beds we noticed that one of them had another guests bags on it,0
a staff member removed the items but did not inform the guest ,0
the guest came back,0
we tried to find the bed he was supposed to be in but they were all occupied,0
it turns out the room had been overbooked,0
security was asked what bed was free but he instead became confrontational and escalated the situation overall a terrible experience,0
nice hostel very well situated and good beds,0
but showers are a bit gross,1
really enjoyed my time here people are nice private dorm was nice and had its own balcony with cool view of city,0
rooftop bar was nice and chill with awesome views,0
also theres a laundry at the front which is helpful,0
heaps of nice cafes and shops right near the hostel too ðŸ˜Š,0
wasnt the greatest stay,0
firstly the hostel seemed dark and dingy,1
we were put in a room with two people who must be living there,0
which made us feel uncomfortable,0
where one of our beds were one of the people living in the room had their fruit by the bed,0
this was making the room smell and attracted loads of flies,1
the other person living in there would come in extremely late with a bike and would make so much noise that we would be woken up,0
would not recommend staying here very odd,0
heard a lot of hype about this place didnt really live up to it location is not easy or comfortable to get to especially at night ,0
food they served was really good ,0
our room had staff coming in and out constantly through the night arguing about who got to sleep in which bed ,0
only stayed one night but the building work outside the 3 flights of stairs to reach reception and general upkeep wouldnt change much ,0
would recommend trying in high season maybe its different,0
i was travelling on my own and the staff made me feel welcomed and my roommates were a great laugh ended up staying with them til we all left,0
its a great location just around the corner from checkpoint charlie and from the ubahn stations also,0
the rooms are cleaned daily although beds are not,1
the showers were really good and the toilets were kept clean,1
overall a really good experience seeing as it was my first time in a hostel,0
the dorms are incredibly small the size of the room for 10 beds was similar to a 4 bed dorm in any other hostel and it smelled very bad,1
great place to stay great location if your not in central paris super close to the metro stations,0
friendly and extremely helpful staff,0
good hostel with sufficient amenities,0
apart from occasional snorers was a good hostel experience,0
excellent value for london the offering is nofrills but everything is thoughtout clean and kept in order,1
very good,0
the rooms are very noisey and hot but the staff gave us a fan when this was mentioned to them,0
amazing stayi have stayed in almost all the hostels of delhi but this was the best hoga home,0
away from home ,0
the management is very supportive and the beds are,0
very clean the kind of enviorment,1
they have created is very relaxing ,0
everything was great from the private ensuite room we had to the amazing food and service we received,0
only issue we had was no one ever came to clean or restock our room during our 4 night stay,1
ran out of toilet paper and desperately needed new towels,1
otherwise very happy with our stay,0
never go back againstaff is so bad  service is extremely unprofessional,0
not recommended only good thing is very close to tube station,0
great if you need to catch an early bus the next day at victoria station,0
one of the best kitchens ive used at a hostel,0
they had everything,0
not enough outlets in the room but they added extension cords and junctions to try and solve the problem,0
more of a hotel than a hostel ,0
great facilities pool sauna football pitch courtyard with art gallery but there is little to no atmosphere,0
the hostel is too big for this courtyard and bar are really large so it is hard to meet people as a solo traveller i imagine this hostel is perfect for groups ,0
only atmosphere is contiki groups coming through if thats youre thing ,0
rooms were the hottest rooms ive ever stayed in there is no ac or even a fan available in the dorms,0
easy to get to with the ubahn,0
staff was helpful but definitely not as excited to have travelers as other hostels,0
the atmosphere was dead when i checked in and not as communal or welcoming as a micro brewery should be,0
it has so much potential but compared to the hostels ive stayed at in the past the environment is lacking ,0
also remember there is no kitchen for guests and breakfast is expensive but free coffee,0
the grocery is close,0
rooms and showers were super nice,0
nakano is far away and its not convenient if youre going out because the trains shut down at 1am,0
the cost of a taxi is going to be incredibly expensive,0
the sheets in the hostel were dirty looking and theres no place to put your bags,1
i had mixed experiences with the staff,0
there was a german indian man who was polite and an older american lady who was extremely helpful,0
however a younger woman with an eastern european accent was quite rude and direct with me,0
amazing,0
highly recommend it,0
beds and bathrooms were super clean,1
showers were clean and private so were bunks which was nice,1
staff was friendly and the rooftop deck was nice to be able to sit and have a drink,0
belleville is an interesting neighborhood but the hostel is a stones throw away from the metro which was great,0
overall this was a pretty great poshtel,0
very clean friendly and efficient staff,1
location was central and was easy to get to any place,0
our room had a window that had some draft which caused some noise,0
other than that it was a pleasant experience,0
id definitely recommend this hostel,0
the staff talked several languages that was great,0
it has a lift,0
room view,0
i would say the bike rental is very inconvenient because you have to give â‚¬50 deposit,0
i could rent somewhere else with no deposit,0
i liked the room,0
but it could be better,0
great place to stay at,0
i stayed here before and will stay again,0
oakhostel cabin provides all that one could ask from a budget hostel and slightly more,0
great location facilities and service,0
there was even a phone to make free localinternational calls provided to all guests,0
it isnt really a hostel more like a youth hotel,0
most staff were quite unfriendly treating questions with visible annoyance and condescension,0
they made both me and fellow travelers feel like a hassle for asking for anything ever,0
one staff member mila is objectively great however â€” super friendly patient and full of recommendations for things to do ,0
expensive hostel in dull but central neighborhood,0
guests seemed like highschoolers,0
dont buy breakfast its overpriced  lacking,0
huge clean hostel with fantastic facilities that made it seem more like a hotel than a hostel,1
excellent location and great bar specials during happy hour,0
i didnt anticipate that the atmosphere would be so clubesq,0
it was noisy at night,0
conducive to dancing and partying,0
the staff were nice and helpful but not friendly,0
the space feels clinical and impersonal,0
it was functional but lacked any personal character,0
great location very safe good facilities and good services ,0
it would have been nice have had a chill space to hangout away from all the partying,0
the internet area had a constant traffic of people entering the clubbar area,0
good location and breakfast,0
no lockers but still a good place to visit the city,0
value for money is highly recommended,0
really good location in front of the canal rooms and bathrooms clean friendly staff downstairs bar and club good vibe sometime too loud,1
but its ok great atmosphere cheap morning market every thursday next to ,0
one thing hostels foods and beds are quite expensive ,0
beside that everything its fine,0
super super cramped rooms,0
no toilets in room and very far away from your room although that is dependant on where youve been put,0
facilities are mostly clean although toiletsshowers are sometimes smelly,1
its great if you just want somewhere to sleep,0
its not a hostel that has regular activities or super friendly staff,0
not somewhere i would recommend if you want to meet people or party,0
overall heart of gold hostel was worth the value,0
staff are incredibly friendly and helpful and the bar had plenty of options,0
rooms were a cool and unique set up with beatiful terrace views which is a massive door left open to other rooms during the night ,0
in our experience there was a lot of action late at night but likely not always the case,0
the toilets were clean and nice,1
the kitchen was a little lacking and a bit small but otherwise it was very nice,0
dedinitely recommend,0
my biggest praise was the cleanliness  ive stayed at other hostels that i cant even compare to this one because it was so clean,1
location was convenient if you dont mind making a few metro transfers to get where you need to go,0
the cubbies had a small wooden locker to put your valuables and the doors to each room had a lock,0
so we felt secure,0
the only caveat to this hostel is that its very quietlaid back,0
so if youre looking for a night life hostel go elsewhere,0
great place to stay in youre looking to stay in the gangnam area,0
no complaints,0
the staff is super nice and friendly,0
have just 2 plugs in a room of 5 dont like that,0
2 showers for all hostel wifi never worked in my stay there i stayed 5 nights,0
a girl in saturday morning said me that it was my phone but they should check the connection cause another girl in my room had the same problem,0
i left some things in the fridge one morning and at afternoon they dissapeared,0
so i never used the fridge again,0
location is great,0
but i wouldnt come back,0
no atmoaphere there,0
the location and atmosphere is amazing,0
the map they give you also is really helpful,0
the area is pretty central and full of great places to eat,0
the bar is good value and has beautiful views of the city,0
the proximity to public transport makes it easy to get everywhere,0
some issues included our keycard not working on the last night also security wasnt properly enforced as strangers from other places being brought into rooms all through the night which didnt make us feel particularly safe,0
hostel wasnt very clean sheets i was given were stained,1
airconditioning in the room was broken,0
front desk people werent very nice ,0
i stayed on the second floor and the only bathroom was downstairs through the bar area and bathroom wasnt really clean,1
decent facilities although its a coed shower,0
staff was mixed some were super helpful and sweet others were rude and off putting,0
close to the u so location isnt too bad,0
miekosan is the japanese mom i never had,0
she makes the hostel very cozy and welcomingâ˜º,0
the stay was perfect,0
nice and helpful staff,0
great atmosphere and amazing food and sunset tours ,0
the hostel is very convenient by metro very close to two stations ,0
i would definitely recommend it,0
i cant recommend this place enough i had no idea where to stay in berlin so just chose the hostel on a whim lucky i did because they were the perfect start to my trip,0
special shout out to issy who checked me in and showed me all the spots around berlin,0
the staff are all locals  let me in on the best marketsbarsthrift storesfood districts etc around the city,0
the hostel is in a great spot to walk  explore kreuzberg and there is a train station 2 mins away,0
also thank u to jan  mauri,0
had an excellent stay,0
would definitely recommend,0
enjoyed a couple pints with the relaxed bar staff who make everyone feel very welcome,0
peter and matt are legends ill be back,0
very close from paddington station and lots of tourist attractions ,0
and i liked the shower room and the toilet,0
some strange practises like having to leave the keys at reception whenever you leave,0
nice outdoor area,0
very nice hostel,0
people seem to complain about the location here but its honestly fine,0
the bar here is really cool also,0
only thing is that there was always a line at reception and it made it a little frustrating when you just had a question to askneeded help with something but had to wait in front of a bunch of people who were checking in,0
i guess since its a larger hostel they are going to have more people at the front desk at once and they cant really help that,0
i was in a three bed female dorm,0
the bathroom was too small it was very difficult to do anything in there and the room was very hot,0
there was a fan,0
but it was on a timer so as soon as it went off the room got hot again,0
the lift is comically small as well,0
it hardly fit two people,0
not very close to the centre of paris but the neighbourhood is cool with nice restaurants etc,0
ok for a couple of nights,0
but i dont think id go back,0
great location and a nice and quiet hostel,0
but during the heat wave the rooms got unbearably hot and one fan in a room for 4 is not enough,0
standard breakfast but with a nicely made table which adds charm,0
its cheap for being london,0
and you get what you pay for,0
nice place in a good location,0
book direct for a free breakfast,0
breakfast is more and daytime baggage storage is more,0
the bathrooms are very small but clean,1
beds a super comfortable work e curtain too ,0
it was nice for an overnight stay,0
the rooms were very clean and the bathrooms were very nice,1
it was very close to the metro,0
would recommend to all,0
main thing to keep in mind theres no kitchen and if youre in a shared room they dont let you bring any food inside with you,0
they do let you know about that rule,0
but it is quite an inconvenience,0
the location is not too far but a definite 2030 minute train ride to most landmarks,0
hostel is a good price for paris the rooms are a very good size with plenty of free space and the curtains add privacy,0
the location is a little out of the way but there are several metro stops a 5 minute walk away,0
the place is loud,0
it is difficult to meet people if on your own and note no kitchen,0
the cleaning staff are rude and will kick you out of the bathroom yelling to clean it,0
a nice quiet hostel with very comfortable beds,0
my partner and i came to london during a few very warm days so the air conditioning in the room was a nice surprise,0
kitchen had two small fridges so we were never at a loss for space however it did lack a stovetop so cooking wasnt the best option for dinner,0
the showers were always clean but also quite small but that wasnt much of an issue,1
overall a very pleasant stay and we plan on going back,0
great hostel with friendly staff in a nice neighborhood,0
they organized plenty of activitÃ© and have a rooftop with an amazing view over the city,0
also the beds are clean and comfortable,1
as far as im concerned this is the best place ive ever stayed at,0
the view is breathtaking and the staff is friendlier than anything ive experienced,0
stay here or youre missing out big time,0
the rooms are extremely small even for a hostel in the sense that there is almost no space to move in the room,0
in case of an accident it would be difficult to move,0
the beds are really uncomfortable,0
there are lockers but they are few in comparison with the hostel capacity so you have to leave your stuff without any kind of security,0
the staff is quite dry,0
the bathrooms were also dirty and the toilet was broken,1
disappointing and totally not recommended,0
everything is cool except for theres no wifi to use in the room but overall everything is great,0
the hostel is located near metro by walking around 8 minutes and the tram is around the corner,0
the host is very friendly and helpful,0
