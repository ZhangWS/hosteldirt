Clink78,21954,London,2018-06-22 00:00:00,review11461141,This hostel and the people we met here made our trip. The only thing I wish it had was an air conditioner in the room as we were on the ground level and our windows opened directly onto a bus stop. I think I'd have felt more comfortable being able to close them but that said I never felt unsafe in this hostel. Apart from that the mix of people was fantastic. Breakfast was £2 with a decent variety and you're a 7 minute walk from one of the most connected tube stations in the city. Loved it!! ,10,8,6,10,8,10,8

1. The showers at this place isn't scorching hot enough for me :(

Only problem is the lack of ventilation / air conditioning. If it's hot when you're there (above 25) the whole building heats up quite considerably - its hotter inside than outside. The windows don't open much, so the room doesn't cool down at night, and there's no air conditioning.

The W14 Hotel & Bar,50220,London,2018-08-31 00:00:00,review11761821,"By far, THE best we stayed at during our 7 country, 14 day honeymoon backing through Europe!  I expected more from breakfast, but there was plenty of food.  I think this was just due to the quality of everything else about this property.

The gentleman who checked us in, and who happened to be there to say goodbye, really gets it. Though I don't recall his name, this guy understands the value of good attitude and service in the hospitality industry. Kudos to you and your team, Sir!",10,10,8,10,10,8,10
Euro Hotel Hammersmith,83156,London,2018-08-02 00:00:00,review11628382,"A very handy location to both Hammersmith & Shepherds Bush underground stations. Breakfast was buffet with cooked options. Small breakfast room so a bit squeezie. The rooms are ensuite, tv, kettle & tea making facilities, nice towel & toiletries. Hot weather meant windows open, not air conditioned but comfortable nevertheless. I was very comfortable & felt it perfectly adequate & good value for money. I would come again. ",10,10,10,10,10,10,8
Arinza Hotel,266580,London,2018-08-18 00:00:00,review11712614,"Booked a twin room, got a double. Not our problem as the mistake happened in the conversion from hostelworld to our system, was the reply from the staff. If you don't like it you can book somewhere else. 

Mold in the room. 

Glad we only needed to stay for one night. 

Bed was good though.

Beaconsfield,11708,London,2018-06-30 00:00:00,review11488429,"I booked this hotel due to its proximity to Finsbury park where me and a friend were seeing a gig.  We arrived at the hotel and paid for the room, were then told the key to the room was broken (why they didn't have a spare key I have no idea!) We were told to wait 15 minutes, we assumed for a spare key to be brought to us but the employee had booked us a taxi and a room in a separate hotel in a not very friendly looking area 40 minutes walk away from the gig venue. Bad experience.. very bad....",2,2,8,2,8,2,2

Surtees,13266,London,2018-07-30 00:00:00,review11621599,"Unpleasant stay and no extras. Charged 1€ to print boarding pass! Breakfast only served for 1 hour in the morning, so we only had 2 of 6 that we were entitled to as our flight out was before that. Really silly- it was basically toast and fruit. We had a family room... in the basement, and it felt like it.  I'm not certain the carpet, thrown over the cement floor, was clean or even dry. Ick! Morning staff complained loudly & bitterly about their jobs the entire time we were there. Terrible vibe! ",4,10,8,2,4,4,6

Royal Hyde Park Hotel,34048,London,2018-07-05 00:00:00,review11527433,"It was grand as we say in Ireland. The room would have been a bit tight if there had been 4 or us.....but never mind. The staff on duty kind too and very helpful with a taxi etc. Ideal situation for us between Queensway and Bayswater underground stations wch is one of the reasons why I booked with u.

Many thanks,
